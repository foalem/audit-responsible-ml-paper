can i get sample dataset?,
Misleading graphs for RNN network Dataset 2,The graphs for the accuracy and loss rates for RNN results for dataset 2 do not have the same scale as the CNN and HAN results. The non-matching scaling factor causes the RNN graphs to indicate higher accuracy than they should when visually compared with the CNN and HAN graphs.
predict,I have already trained and got a model. How to predict for a new data now?
Typo in CNN.ipynb,"    for idx in range(data_train.message.shape[0]):
        text = BeautifulSoup(data_train.message[idx])
        texts.append(clean_str(str(text.get_text().encode())))
    
    for idx in data_train['class']:
        labels.append(idx)

Should be:
    
    for idx in range(df.message.shape[0]):
        text = BeautifulSoup(df.message[idx])
        texts.append(clean_str(str(text.get_text().encode())))
    
    for idx in df['class']:
        labels.append(idx)

(In the CNN code)"
Data Sample,"Hi, 

Cane we please have a sample of the data that you pushed into it?"
Create requirements.txt,Basic file for easier cloning and running the repo
data_train in CNN.ipynb,"Line 5 of block 6 has a variable data_train which comes out of blue.

Please see if it is the case of missing block of naming inconsistency.

Thanks

Share datasets,"Hello, this report so cool. I never imagined that CNN have great results on text classification. I wanna to try reproduce and maybe add other parameters like dropout to make more accurate, can you share the datasets? or script for scrapping datasets?

Thank you for your great explanation too on your blog!"

Cheetah Issue: ,"Hi, I am trying to use the cheetah streaming with microphone option.
I am trying to use the cheetah.process, and the requested format is:

:param pcm: A frame of audio samples. The number of samples per frame can be attained by calling
        `.frame_length`. The incoming audio needs to have a sample rate equal to `.sample_rate` and be 16-bit
        linearly-encoded. Furthermore, Cheetah operates on single-channel audio.

how can I live stream an audio that will answer the requirements?
I am using python, and I tried PyAudio but was not successful.
I will appreciate help and examples from someone who managed to do so.

Thanks!
"
React native vp updates,"Just the demo, so no release necessary"
Acoustic Echo Cancellation,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
If I am playing back synthesized voice and I am also listening to the microphone with Cheetah, I will get the synth content transcribed by cheetah.  I have been looking into Acoustic Echo Cancellation to get around this.  Before I implement something with say SpeexDSP I thought it is worth asking if there is a feature from Picovoice that will accomplish this?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
If Cheetah has integrated AEC that would be ideal.  Alternatively there is a filter or something like it that I could insert into the TargetDataLine (I am using Java API) before passing to Cheetah.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I've considered implementing my own AEC with SpeexDSP.  It is a C library so I would need to understand Speex itself, C and JNI to do this.  It is possible, but if it is an already solved problem then I would prefer to go that route..

**Additional context**
If there is another alternative I would be interested to learn of it.  I know that Android platform has Java version of AEC but I am not sure if that will work in generic Java environment.  I also understand ByteDance has a solution however it is proprietary and I am not sure how to evaluate..

Cheetah Issue: pvcheetah._cheetah.CheetahActivationError,"Make sure you have read the documentation, and have put forth a reasonable effort to find an existing answer.

### Expected behaviour

Starts Fine

### Actual behaviour

Errors with pvcheetah._cheetah.CheetahActivationError

### Steps to reproduce the behaviour

Enter startup code
Run program
Error Appears
(Include enough details so that the issue can be reproduced independently.)

Update demo with new flutter vp v1.1,
Cheetah custom models unavailable,"Hello is there any update on this ?

iOS demo updates,
Cheetah + Eagle,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I want to identify people speaking in live transcriptions. However, I can't find a way to correlate the output of Eagle (https://picovoice.ai/docs/api/eagle-web/) with the output of Cheetah because Cheetah is async (no correlation of output to the input frame), whereas Eagle gives one-to-one results correlated with input audio frame.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Any way of making Eagle work with Cheetah.

Perhaps timestamps in Cheetah output so I can correlate the results myself, or direct integration of Eagle into Cheetah. Or at minimum, a specific awaitable sync API that I can use to process an audio frame, like Eagle has:

```
async function process(pcm: Int16Array): Promise<number[]>
```

Though for Cheetah, it could be:
```
async function process(pcm: Int16Array): Promise<string>
```

Even just THAT would be enough...can we get an async `process` call?

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
`whisper.cpp`

Cheetah (temporarily unavailable) ?,"![image](https://github.com/Picovoice/picovoice/assets/64015162/02417683-c14a-4340-929a-087e80104faf)
Curently there seem to be some issue to download a cheetah model (any language) any update on this ?
While this is beeing fixed I can use the default model (english) here https://github.com/Picovoice/cheetah/tree/master/lib/common 
but are the source files for others language avalable somewhere ?
Thanks !"
Update libs with v1.1 patches,
Cheetah Issue: Stack overflow crash in Cheetah during processing,"I have been integrating and evaluating Cheetah in a MacOS desktop application (Cheetah C library, arm64) and have been experiencing this issue, which is blocker for further development. I have been unable to debug this much further without understanding what could cause this behaviour inside the cheetah library.

### Expected behaviour

Transcription should be output

### Actual behaviour

App crashes with very large backtrace inside cheetah library

### Steps to reproduce the behaviour

Run the transcription for some time (10-15 minutes) eventually app will crash after working correctly during that time.

MacOS 13.0.1
Cheetah C library (latest version)
Target is MacOS

As far as I can tell, the buffer passed to pv_cheetah_process is valid, has content, and is accessible. App crashes with EXC_BAD_ACCESS and appears to be a stack overflow type crash.

The app and transcription works perfectly fine for some time before this happens. The crash consistently occurs after around 10 minutes runtime.

I am using AVAudioEngine to tap an input microphone. The buffer provided is converted and then fed into picovoice/cheetah.

### Backtrace

Error when attempting to provide model argument to web binding ,"Make sure you have read the documentation, and have put forth a reasonable effort to find an existing answer.

### Expected behaviour

When creating an instance of the Cheetah engine with React in an attempt to use cheetah for  web, no methods I've tried are able to read the model file. 

### Actual behaviour

I receive the message
```The provided model doesn't contain a valid publicPath or base64 value``` 

### Steps to reproduce the behaviour

I try to create an instance of cheetah like so:

```
cheetah = await Cheetah.create(
        accessKey,
        cheetahTranscriptionCallback,
        './cheetah_model.pv'
      )

```
I've also tried importing the file (`import * as cheetahModel from './cheetah_model.pv`),  using Buffer to do base64 encoding and passing the result of that in, nothing works. What am i doing incorreclty here?

Bump bumpalo from 3.10.0 to 3.12.0 in /demo/rust/micdemo,"Bumps [bumpalo](https://github.com/fitzgen/bumpalo) from 3.10.0 to 3.12.0.
<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/fitzgen/bumpalo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md"">bumpalo's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>3.12.0</h2>
<p>Released 2023-01-17.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added the <code>bumpalo::boxed::Box::bump</code> and <code>bumpalo::collections::String::bump</code>
getters to get the underlying <code>Bump</code> that a string or box was allocated into.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some uses of <code>Box</code> that MIRI did not previously consider as UB are now
reported as UB, and <code>bumpalo</code>'s internals have been adjusted to avoid the new
UB.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3.11.1</h2>
<p>Released 2022-10-18.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where when <code>std::vec::IntoIter</code> was ported to
<code>bumpalo::collections::vec::IntoIter</code>, it didn't get its underlying <code>Bump</code>'s
lifetime threaded through. This meant that <code>rustc</code> was not checking the
borrows for <code>bumpalo::collections::IntoIter</code> and this could result in
use-after-free bugs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3.11.0</h2>
<p>Released 2022-08-17.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for per-<code>Bump</code> allocation limits. These are enforced only in the
slow path when allocating new chunks in the <code>Bump</code>, not in the bump allocation
hot path, and therefore impose near zero overhead.</li>
<li>Added the <code>bumpalo::boxed::Box::into_inner</code> method.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Rust 2021 edition.</li>
<li>The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now 1.56.0.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

Is cheetah only available in english ?,"Hello, sorry this might be a dumb question...

I can't figure out how to change the language for this model, e.g select a model
for the others I can find them under https://github.com/Picovoice/rhino/tree/master/lib/common 

but here I only find the default one
https://github.com/Picovoice/cheetah/tree/master/lib/common
Should I understand only the default version is avalaible yet ?

If this is the case,
do you plan to add more language to this model when would that be ?

I couldn't find those info, so thanks for your reply :)

Web SDK update,
Absolute path for model file - Expo/React Native,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm attempting to use Picovoice-cheetah with an existing Expo react native application. Unfortunately, expo does not have an easy way to bundle the file into the application's asset directory for android, instead opting for it's own [asset management lib](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/asset/). AFIK the Cheetah.create method is relative to the /asset/ path only.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like to simply provide an absolute path to the file system. I.e.: 
`file:///data/user/0/app/cache/ExponentAsset-4e3f888fc8475f69fd5fa32f1ad5216a.pv`

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I'm not going to eject my app for this. 

**Additional context**
The model is fairly large, supporting this feature would also allow the model to be shipped independently of the app reducing bundle sizes.

While I run the release of my app on my phone via Android Studio and start the Cheetah voice recognition, the app crashes.

  flutter_voice_processor: ^1.0.6
  cheetah_flutter: ^1.0.0
and in the same yaml I have following assets :
    - assets/models/android/cheetah_params.pv
    - assets/models/ios/cheetah_params.pv

One section from stack trace has caught my eye, because it mentions picovoice and lack of a specific method. Here is the stack trace.

Please let me know what could possibly be the problem.

Recognizing Polish language in Cheetah speech-to-text,"Hi Picovoice team!

I am working on my Computer Science Master's Thesis, which is a mobile application for tracking the progress of your goals using the voice interface. I will be performing studies, which will compare user engagement with and without user interface to determine if voice control is something that increases the productivity and engagement of users.

I have searched through available solutions for Flutter and there is no other voice recognition solution as good as Picovoice! 😄 
In terms of API, reliability, and latency it is unmatched.

MVP is aimed primarily at the Polish market, which leads to my question: how can support for the Polish language be added?
Currently, the app has the most emphasis on continuous voice-to-text, which is why I am asking about Cheetah.

Hope to hear from you.

Best,
Dastin  Sandura"

<blockquote>
<h2>v0.64.1</h2>
<p>This patch release is specifically targetted towards fixing iOS build problems in Xcode 12.5. If it doesn't help, please refer to <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/facebook/react-native/issues/31480"">this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from bumping your version from 0.64.0 to 0.64.1, please check your podfile.lock and make sure that Flipper is on 0.75 or higher, and Flipper-Folly is 2.5.3 or higher; if not, add this line to your podfile (or modify it if you already had it):</p>
<pre><code>use_flipper!('Flipper' =&gt; '0.75.1', 'Flipper-Folly' =&gt; '2.5.3', 'Flipper-RSocket' =&gt; '1.3.1')
</code></pre>
<p>After which, do all the classic necessary cleans (node_modules, caches, pod folders, etc)(<a href=""https://github.com/pmadruga/react-native-clean-project"">react-native-clean-project</a> is your ally) then do <code>yarn install</code> and a <code>pod install --repo-update</code> (if pod install fails on an error about a Flipper package, just remove the relevant lines from the podfile.lock and run the pod install again).</p>
<p>The only other commit picked &amp; released along the Xcode 12.5 fixes is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update validateBaseUrl to use latest regex (<a href=""https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/ca09ae82715e33c9ac77b3fa55495cf84ba891c7"">commit</a>) which fixes CVE-2020-1920, GHSL-2020-293.</li>

<blockquote>
<h2>v0.62.3</h2>
<p>This patch release is specifically targetted towards Xcode 12.5. The changes done are tailored to unblock developers still relying on v0.62 of RN.</p>
<p>Aside from bumping your version from 0.62.2 to 0.62.3, please make sure to add this line to your podfile (or modify it if you already had it):</p>
<pre><code>use_flipper!('Flipper' =&gt; '0.75.1', 'Flipper-Folly' =&gt; '2.5.3', 'Flipper-RSocket' =&gt; '1.3.1')
</code></pre>
<p>After which, do all the classic necessary cleans (node_modules, caches, pod folders, etc)(<a href=""https://github.com/pmadruga/react-native-clean-project"">react-native-clean-project</a> is your ally) then do <code>yarn install</code> and a <code>pod install --repo-update</code> (if pod install fails on an error about a Flipper package, just remove the relevant lines from the podfile.lock and run the pod install again).</p>
<p>The only other commit picked &amp; released along the Xcode 12.5 fixes is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update validateBaseUrl to use latest regex (<a href=""https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/ca09ae82715e33c9ac77b3fa55495cf84ba891c7"">commit</a>) which fixes CVE-2020-1920, GHSL-2020-293.</li>

Raspberry pi unable to setup,"So I have been trying to get this to work without success. 

I am trying to get this to work on the raspberry pi 4. does anyone have any idea on how to achieve this? i'm rather new to the linux system. 

I can install the list of requirements but past that, no idea on what i'm doing wrong. 
else, is there a tutorial somewhere? I really don't want to use the googleAPI..

there is plenty of information on the website and on github but for people who are still new like me, the struggle is real. 

to get an idea on what im trying to achieve:
use Picovoice Cheetah to directly convert speech to text
use Picovoice Porcupine for custom word trigger. 

any help would be much appreciated

-Logan"
Availability of license path,I couldn't find any license paths in the mentioned links. Not available in picovoice console.
Customize cheetah STT engine to understand specific terms.,"I am currently testing the cheetah speech-to-text engine on my pc. The accuracy of the speech-to-text conversion is not coming so satisfying. It's not recognizing some specific words and some industry-specific terms. So, How can we train it to understand specialized terms? "
Flutter plugin,"do you guys offer flutter plugin for this to work next to picovoice manager?

"I had an issue ""building wheel for pyaudio"" when installing on a virtualbox linux (ugly red error text)","I fixed it by installing portaudio modules with this simple line:

train cheetah model,I am currently testing the cheetah real time demo on my pc. but the accuracy of the speech to text conversion is not comming so satisfying. What is the method to train the model with my own voice?
Rhino on Cheetah?,Can I use Cheetah as the input for Rhino to derive its Intent?
Windows vs Linux Performance,"Hi, Can I know more about the difference in performance for running Cheetah on Linux v.s Windows? (if any). Currently, I will like to demo Cheetah on windows but it is only available on Linux."
feat: add show_audio_devices_info as pArg ,
stream audio from standard in pipe?,"Is it possible to use the cheetah python real time demo with an audio source from a standard in pipe, or from a FIFO buffer file, so that I can, for example, stream an audio source from somewhere else (like a microphone on another PC, over the network)?"
License cross-platform question,"I just generated a Linux x86_64 cheetah license, but would now like to try the Windows or Raspberry Pi version.

Two questions:
1) Can I use the Linux x86_64 license on Windows, or an ARM powered Raspberry Pi?
2) If not, since I have a limit of 1 license, can I ""expire"" the one I have so I can generate one that will work on Windows or a Pi?"
Can I use cheetah in window 10 without  registering the company name,I want to use cheetah for educational purpose but it want company name and email . Can I use it without providing company name or email.
"Can the output be normal case, rather than all uppercase?","I noticed in your demo video, and when I set up cheetah and tried it, that the output is in ALL CAPS.

I am looking for a solution that would give me speech to text for document creation purposes. ALL CAPS is not useful as it would have to be processed to put it in to normal casing.  

Is there an option to make cheetah output the text with normal casing and capitalization?

[Error] License file has incorrect format,"Hi,
I see you have addressed this issue before, but I seem to have the same one.  I have the supported version of Linux, on a x86_64 machine, but still have the same problem.

I started with a clean clone of the git repo.

Request to extend to other operating systems,"I'm developing a program to help people control their computers using their voice called Deus: https://www.deus-ai.com. [Github link](https://github.com/nuttyartist/deus). Deus is open-source and free.

I'm currently using Google's Speech-to-text engine but I'd really like to use Cheetah since it's running offline. That will help with security and privacy but not merely since with enough users I won't be able to afford Google's billing all by myself. But currently, only Linux is supported for non-commercial use with Cheetah. Deus is a cross-platform application and I'd like it to stay that way. Can you help me by making Cheetah supported on Mac and Windows also?

Your technologies are incredibly impressive and I think Deus will be an interesting way to show them off.

Cheetah licensing,"I developed a speech-to-text application for sharing the transcript to many concurrently.
See [https://github.com/zSeriesGuy/SpeakReader](https://github.com/zSeriesGuy/SpeakReader)

It takes microphone or line-in input to the server and sends the transcription to any number of connected web browsers.
It currently uses the Google Speech-to-text cloud platform. But I intend to extend it to support other speech-to-text engines.
I found Cheetah to be an interesting option.

How does the licensing work? My project requires the user of the app to set up their own license with Google Cloud. If I were to incorporate Cheetah as a selectable stt engine option, how would someone obtain a license file?
