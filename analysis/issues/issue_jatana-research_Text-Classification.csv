can i get sample dataset?,
Misleading graphs for RNN network Dataset 2,The graphs for the accuracy and loss rates for RNN results for dataset 2 do not have the same scale as the CNN and HAN results. The non-matching scaling factor causes the RNN graphs to indicate higher accuracy than they should when visually compared with the CNN and HAN graphs.
predict,I have already trained and got a model. How to predict for a new data now?
Typo in CNN.ipynb,"    for idx in range(data_train.message.shape[0]):
        text = BeautifulSoup(data_train.message[idx])
        texts.append(clean_str(str(text.get_text().encode())))
    
    for idx in data_train['class']:
        labels.append(idx)

Should be:
    
    for idx in range(df.message.shape[0]):
        text = BeautifulSoup(df.message[idx])
        texts.append(clean_str(str(text.get_text().encode())))
    
    for idx in df['class']:
        labels.append(idx)

(In the CNN code)"
Data Sample,"Hi, 

Cane we please have a sample of the data that you pushed into it?"
Create requirements.txt,Basic file for easier cloning and running the repo
data_train in CNN.ipynb,"Line 5 of block 6 has a variable data_train which comes out of blue.

Please see if it is the case of missing block of naming inconsistency.

Thanks
R"
Share datasets,"Hello, this report so cool. I never imagined that CNN have great results on text classification. I wanna to try reproduce and maybe add other parameters like dropout to make more accurate, can you share the datasets? or script for scrapping datasets?

Thank you for your great explanation too on your blog!"
