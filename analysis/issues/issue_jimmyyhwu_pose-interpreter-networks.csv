because we take the max, usually, only one position will have the max value.

I thought we should select independently and choose those words with >0.5 probability.

Multiple GPUs is broken,"Hi Yala! 

Great package. Just letting you know, though, that computation on multiple GPU's is broken for two reasons:

1. The `model.py` file does not import 
``import torch.nn as nn``
that's an easy fix.

2. You have some class-attribute dependencies that are single-thread bound.

Code sharing,"Hi @mdabros,

For about 15 years, I was the main maintainer of a project called the Accord.NET Framework, which was mainly a machine learning/statistics processing framework for .NET. I have recently archived the project as I couldn't keep up updating it. If there is anything that you would ever find useful in Accord/its codebase, I just wanted to let you know that I have granted license to anyone who would like to, to reuse any piece of code I have written myself (as per noted in the headers of each file of the project) under the MIT or BSD licenses.

I still continue to receive requests on how to use/adapt existing features, even after the project has been archived, so I guess there are still useful things that have been implemented in that framework. If you would like to adapt any of those into SharpLearning, please let me know.

All the best and merry Christmas if you celebrate it!

Exception when serializing neural net to XML,"Hello,

I am using SharpLearning.Neural version 0.31.8 in a .Net Core 3.1 project. After training a neural network and obtaining the predictor model, I try to serialize it to an XML file using the suggested procedure:

```csharp
GenericXmlDataContractSerializer xmlSerializer = new GenericXmlDataContractSerializer();
xmlSerializer.Serialize<IPredictorModel<double>>(_model, () => new StreamWriter(filePath));
```

It fails with the following SerializationException:

System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException: An object of type 'SharpLearning.InputOutput.Serialization.GenericXmlDataContractSerializer+GenericResolver' which derives from DataContractResolver returned false from its TryResolveType method when attempting to resolve the name for an object of type 'MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra.Storage.DenseVectorStorage`1[[System.Single, System.Private.CoreLib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e]]', indicating that the resolution failed.

Continuously improving a neural network over time using small batches.,"Hey, first of thanks for a fantastic library!

The library is really easy and simple to use if you have a large dataset and want to train a network in one go.

But I'm building a DQN and I want to continuously improve a neural network from small batches of training data, with as little overhead as possible. Is that something that's easily possible in SharpLearning?

Right now, the only way I see it can be achive, is by doing something like this:

    var net = new NeuralNet();
    // ...

    while (true)
    {
        var learner = new NeuralNetLearner(net, new CopyTargetEncoder(), new SquareLoss());
        // ...
        net = learner.Learn(observations, targets);
    }

However there's a lot of overhead and data copying going on there. Are there better ways to go about it?

Thanks  :)

**Edit 1** : Seems like my example doesn't work either since the weights are randomized when a learning begins.

**Edit 2**: My seccond attempt, throws a nullreference exception on net.Forward(input, output). (Allthough I imagine that this is not a very good way to go about it either? And probably wrong on many levels 😊)

    var delta = Matrix<float>.Build.Dense(1, 1);
    var input = Matrix<float>.Build.Dense(inputCount, 1);
    var output = Matrix<float>.Build.Dense(1, 1);

    while (true)
    {
            PopulateInput(input)
            net.Forward(input, output);
            var expected = GetExpected();
            delta[0, 0] = (float)(expected - output[0, 0]);
            net.Backward(delta);
    }"
Serialization Exception,"Hi. 

Not sure what happened, but something happened :) 

1. I updated all projects from .NET Core 3.0 to 3.1 
2. Made some changes in MySQL DB 

Now, I get various errors from `GenericXmlDataContractSerializer`. Surprisingly, exception happens only when I build project the second time, after the first build it works fine. I mentioned DB, because I serialize trained model using `MemoryStream` and save it as a byte[] to the MySQL column of type LongBlob. I'm also using models from `ML.NET` and export / import them from DB the same way and they work fine, so probably DB is not an issue. All projects in the solution are built as x64. Serializer fails on any model, either `RandomForest` or `AdaBoost`, with the same exception. 

**The issue** 

1. build the project and start debugging 
2. create, train model, and save it to DB as byte array using `GetPredictor` method below 
3. select byte array from DB, deserialize to a model, provide test data and get estimate - **OK** 
4. stop debugging, repeat steps 1-3, now prediction method fails with the exception below - **NOT OK**

**The question**

Maybe somebody knows what could be the reason for serializer to fall with the exception? Also, can I serialize trained model to `MemoryStream` using different serializer, without `GenericXmlDataContractSerializer`? 

**Most common exception**
```
System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationException: Element 'http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/Core.Learners.SharpLearning.EngineSpace:Model' contains data from a type that maps to the name 'SharpLearning.RandomForest.Models:ClassificationForestModel'. The deserializer has no knowledge of any type that maps to this name. Consider changing the implementation of the ResolveName method on your DataContractResolver to return a non-null value for name 'ClassificationForestModel' and namespace 'SharpLearning.RandomForest.Models' 
```

**After updating all Nuget packages I got another exception only once** 
```
Invalid XML at line 1 or something like that
```

**Serializing trained model to byte array and save to DB** 

```C#
public virtual ResponseModel<byte> GetPredictor(IDictionary<int, string> columns, IDataView inputs)
{
  var responseModel = new ResponseModel<byte>();

  using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
  {
    var processor = GetInput(columns, inputs, nameof(PredictorLabelsEnum.Emotion));
    var learner = new ClassificationRandomForestLearner();
    var serializer = new GenericXmlDataContractSerializer();
    var container = new MapModel<int, string>
    {
      Map = processor.Map,
      Model = learner.Learn(processor.Input.Observations, processor.Input.Targets)
    };
    
    serializer.Serialize(container, () => new StreamWriter(memoryStream));
    responseModel.Items = memoryStream.ToArray().ToList();
  }

  return responseModel;
}
```

**Deserializing model from DB stream and getting prediction** 

```C#
public virtual ResponseModel<string> GetEstimate(IEnumerable<byte> predictor, IDictionary<int, string> columns, IDataView inputs)
{
  var responseModel = new ResponseModel<string>();

  using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream(predictor.ToArray()))
  {
    var processor = GetInput(columns, inputs);
    var serializer = new GenericXmlDataContractSerializer();
    var model = serializer.Deserialize<MapModel<int, string>>(() => new StreamReader(memoryStream));
    var predictions = model.Predict(processor.Input.Observations);

    responseModel.Items.Add(predictions.OrderByDescending(o => o.Key).First().Value);
  }

  return responseModel;
}
```

Method `GetInput` in the code above is just a conversion from `IDataView` format in ML.NET to `ObservationSet` format in `SharpLearning`. `MapModel` is a [wrapper](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/issues/132) that allows to save text labels along with numeric ones. "

Is there a way to keep textual labels / targets as a part of the trained model?,"First of all, thank you for sharing this library. 
Second, would be great to make mapping between columns and feature names mode obvious. 
If model was serialized and saved on one computer and deserialized and loaded on the other one, then second computer will have no idea what's the meaning of labels / targets, because model keeps them as double values. 

**Save model**

```C#

var labels = new[] { ""Good"", ""Bad"", ""Average"" ...  };
var labelKeys = labels.Select((v, i) => (double) i);  // take label key instead of name 
var learner = new ClassificationDecisionTreeLearner();
var model = learner.Learn(items, labelKeys); // is there any reason not to use string labels instead of doubles?

using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
{
  var serializer = new GenericXmlDataContractSerializer();
  serializer.Serialize<IPredictorModel<double>>(model, () => new StreamWriter(memoryStream));
  db.Save(memoryStream.ToArray());  // convert XML to byte[] and save as Blob to DB
}
```

**Load model**

```C#
var xmlModel = db.Get(...).AsBlob().GetBytes(); // load saved model from blob column in DB

using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream(xmlModel))
{
  var serializer = new GenericXmlDataContractSerializer();
  var xml = serializer.Deserialize<IPredictorModel<double>>(() => new StreamReader(memoryStream));
}
```

As a result, loaded model has property `Targets` that contains some double values, like 1, 2, 3, 4 and there is no way to understand that initially they meant ""Good"", ""Bad"", etc 

**Question**

Is there a way to save original **string labels / targets** as a part of the model to make prediction results human-readable? "
0.31.8.0: Ensure deterministic order of results from multithreaded optimizers,"Fix #130 and make order of results deterministic for all optimizers when running with parallel execution. Results will now also be the same between single threaded and multithreaded execution.

This affects all optimizers supporting parallel execution:
 - `BayesianOptimizer`
 - `GlobalizedBoundedNelderMeadOptimizer`
 - `GridSearchOptimizer`
 - `ParticleSwarmOptimizer`
 - `RandomSearchOptimizer`
"
Order of results from RandomSearch is not deterministic with different iteration counts.,"Running the `RandomSearchOptimizer` with `runPrallel=false`, so not multithreading, with 100 iterations and 120 iterations seem to provide different order of results. Expectation would be that the fist 100 iteration would be the same, and this is not currently the case.
This is most likely caused by the use of `ConcurrentBag` to collect the results, which does not guarantee order.

This might also affect other Optimizers supporting parallel execution,"

0.31.7.0: Refactor BaysianOptimizer and add parallel computation,"This pull request refactors the `BayesianOptimizer` implementation to be use the same principles as the `SMACOptimizer`. The two optimizers are both model based optimizers, and should therefore be very similar in implementation. The `BayesianOptimizer` can be viewed a basic implementation of model based optimization, which the `SMACOptimizer` builds a few tricks on top of.
A base class for model based optimizers seems to be the next logical step, but that will follow in a later pull request.

The refactoring enables use of the `BayesianOptimizer` in an ""open loop"" style just like the `SMACOptimizer`. See the unit tests for an example.

This pull request also adds the option of parallel computation to the `BayesianOptimizer`. This work was originally added in #119.

Note that when running in parallel, and using the `Optimize(Func<double[], OptimizerResult> functionToMinimize)` method, the order of the results will not be reproducible. The individuel results will remain the same, but the order of the results will vary between runs.

I recommend only using the parallel version if the provided `functionToMinimize` is running serial computation, and is slow to compute."

In SharpLearning.InputOutput.Csv.CsvParser -> Dictionary<string, int> TrimSplitLineTrimColumnsToDictionary(string line)
there's an iteration over the headers line, but it assumes all headers are distinct (and also that it is the headers line) - therefore an exception of ""key already exists in dictionary"" is thrown.
I think it should check if there's a duplication and throw a more explanatory error message in such case.

This also entailed a change to the standard serial behaviour so that instead of skipping an evaluation if the parameters did not change from the previous run, it will now store the results for all evaluations and skip any that have been run before.

Add azure pipelines yaml configuration,"This pull request adds `azure-pipelines.yaml` configuration to control CI and PR validation. This also adds both debug and release validation. Previously, only the release version was build and tested via CI. 

This addition is the bare minimum of the yaml configuration. BuildPlatform has not been added to the configuration yet. I could not make it work together with the dotnet build command. Information on this can be found here: [dotnet issue 10421](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/10421). So currently, the build platform from the project files is used.

I am currently using 'tasks' for the individual steps, but it seems that 'scripts' are generally more popular for dotnet core pipelines. Here is a guide using scripts: [yaml-build-pipeline-net-core-azure-devops-tutorial)](https://www.nankov.com/posts/yaml-build-pipeline-net-core-azure-devops-tutorial)

Another example is the [TorchSharp pipeline](https://github.com/xamarin/TorchSharp/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml), but that also handles additional steps for getting external resources etc.. 'Scripts' definitely seems more flexible than 'tasks', so I might switch to 'scripts' in the future when I have some more experience with them."

Understand class prediction results,"Hi,
maybe some silly questions...
I'm trying to train a random forest model with **two different classes**. I think I understood that the number of rows of the target vector must be equal to observations matrix (therefore regardless of the number of classes). So in the rows of the output vector I set the value 0 for the first class and 1 for the second class. **This is right?** 
I would also like to understand how to interpret the results, for example if for a set of features I have the prediction value 0.6 I must consider it a class of type ""0"" or a class of type ""1""? Do I have to cast to integer or I must to round it? Finally the ""variance"" values ​​contained in CertaintyPrediction indicates the probability of the prediction (greater is better)?
many thanks

"0.31.1.0: Add SmacOptimizer, update argument names on HyperbandOptimizer and BayesianOptimizer, clean up SharpLearning.Optimization.Test project","This pull request adds the `SmacOptimizer` to `SharpLearning.Optimization`. The implementation is based on the paper: [Sequential Model-Based Optimization for General Algorithm Configuration](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/11-LION5-SMAC.pdf).

The algorithm combines bayesian optimization with greedy local search based on the current top solutions.

The `SmacOptimizer` implements the regular `IOptimizer` interface, but also surfaces the two primary methods for running the algorithm `ProposeParameterSets` and `RunParameterSets`. This makes it possible to use the optimizer in an ""open-loop"" style, and allows the optimizer to be easily used from or combined with other optimizers. An examples could be using the scheduling technique from the `HyberbandOptimizer` together with the model based sampling from the `SmacOptimizer`.

An example showing ""open-loop"" use can be found in the `SmacOptimizerTest` class."

Make individual Tree models public on ForestModels. This is a breaking change. Also clean up SharpLearning.RandomForest.Test,"This pull request makes the individual tree models public on the forest models: `RegressionForestModel` and `ClassificationForestModel`. This makes it possible to use the individual trees from the model for custom predictions, or for calculating statistics. For instance, using a different ensemble strategy than average for regression and majority vote for classification. Getting the predictions for the individual trees also makes it possible to calculate statistics on the predictions to see how much the ensemble of models agrees or disagress.

The tree models are accessed through the `.Trees` property of the forest models:

```CSharp
var learner = new RegressionRandomForestLearner();
var forest = learner.Learn(observations, targets);
var trees = forest.Trees;
```

The trees can then be used individually afterwards:

```CSharp
var prediction = trees.Select(t => t.Predict(observation)).Average();
```

Note that this is a **breaking change**, since the trees have been promoted from a private member to a public property. This means that it will not be possible to load ForestModels trained with earlier versions of SharpLearning into this version. So retraining of models from the `SharpLearning.RandomForest` project is mandatory if updating to 0.31.0.0 and newer versions. This is sadly the downside of serializing the model code directly instead of using a custom format, which is the current strategy in SharpLearning.

0.30.2: Add HyperbandOptimizer.OptimizeBest method,Add missing `OptimizeBest` method for the `HyperbandOptimizer`. This method returns the best result found by the optimizer
"0.30.1.0: Add HyperbandOptimizer, and update test adapters","This pull request adds the `HyperbandOptimizer` to `SharpLearning.Optimization`. The implementation is based on the original article [Hyperband](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06560.pdf) and the implementation by [fastml](http://fastml.com/tuning-hyperparams-fast-with-hyperband/).

Compared to the other optimizers from SharpLearning, Hyperband includes an extra parameter in the objective function, `unitsOfCompute`. Hyperband uses the `unitsOfCompute` parameter to control a budget of compute for each set of hyperparameters. Initially it will run each parameter set with very little compute budget to get a taste of how they perform. Then it takes the best performers and runs them on a larger budget.

The `unitOfCompute` parameter is used in the objective function, and could for instance be used to control the size of the training set, the number of trees in gradient boost, or the number of epochs for neural nets. One unit of compute could for instance be defined as 1000 samples in the training set. The `maximumUnitsOfCompute` is provided as an argument to the `HyperbandOptimizer`, and the optimzer will define a schedule for evaluating the hyperparameters on a budget.

A small experiment comparing the results and runtime of the `HyperbandOptimizer` vs. the `RandomSearchOptimizer`, optimizing a neural net (using CNTK) on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

**System**
**CPU: i7-4770**
**GPU: GTX1070**

The Hyperband optimizers uses the default parameters except for the `skipLastIterationOfEachRound` which is enabled for one of the runs. The default parameters result in a total of 209 different parameter sets tried with the Hyberband optimizers. The `unitsOfCompute` parameter in the objective function is used to control the size of the training set, where 1 unit of compute is set to 740 samples, which corresponds to the full training set size of 60.000 samples, when `maximumUnitsOfCompute` is set to 81, which is the default maximum. The full test set is used to track the test loss/accuracy in all rounds/iterations.

| Optimizer        | Time (hours)           | Test accuracy (%)  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| `RandomSearchOptimizer(iterations=100)`|  45.34 |  88.47 |
| `HyperbandOptimizer(skipLastIterationOfEachRound=false)` |  10.46  |   87.93 |
| `HyperbandOptimizer(skipLastIterationOfEachRound=true)`|  6.56  | 87.93 |

As can be seen the RandomSearchOptimizer finds a slightly better parameter set. However, the two Hyperband runs uses significant less time to find a solution that is nearly as good. In this case, skipping the last iteration of each round results in finding the same parameter set as when including all iterations. This will not be the case for all problem types, but it does provide a nice speed up for large problems.

In the end, Hyperband finds a solution that is almost as good, and reduces the time required by a factor of 4-7.

A future extension to the hyperband optimizer could be to use bayesian optimization instead of random search to select the parameter sets. This combination has proven very useful in: [Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization at Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01774.pdf)."
"Add support for Reinforcement Learning algorithms: QLearning, Sarsa etc.","There is currently support for most of the common (and some less common) ML algorithms in Sharp Learning. However, there does appear to be a lack in the area of Reinforcement Leaning and some might observe these algorithms are beginning to gain some traction.

If there is any appetite for extending into this area, I would propose as an initial baseline provision for QLearning and Sarsa, backed by Epsilon Greedy and Boltzmann approaches. A second stage could then continue with Thompson and UCB1 exploration, and finally the existing Neural Net and ensemble interfaces could probably produce a compound that resembled Deep Q Networks."
0.30.0: Optimizers Optimize method returns unfiltered results in chronological order,"The `Optimize ` method on the optimizers from `SharpLearning.Optimization` will now return all results, unfiltered and in chronological order. Before, the results would be filtered for `NaN` values and ordered from smallest to largest error. This change makes it easier to compare the iterations required to get a good solution between the optimizers. The `OptimizeBest` method, which returns the single best result from the optimizers, is unchanged and will provide exactly the same result as previously.

This is a potential breaking change, so if relaying on the order of the results from the `Optimize` method, these should now be sorted and/or filtered after the call to the optimizer. Like it is also done in the `OptimizeBest` method:

```CSharp
Optimize(functionToMinimize).Where(v => !double.IsNaN(v.Error)).OrderBy(r => r.Error).First();
```

Note, that the particle swarm optimizer only returns the latest result from each particle."

Optimization: Rename Transforms.Logarithmic to Transforms.Log10,"Currently, the name of the logarithmic transform is misleading, since in the .Net world log refers to log2, and the [LogarithmicTransform](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/blob/master/src/SharpLearning.Optimization/Transforms/LogarithmicTransform.cs) from SharpLearning uses Log10. 

So the transform, and the enum should be renamed to illustrate the use of Log10. For instance:
 - `Transforms.Log10`
 - `Log10Transform`"
Add IParameterSpec to SharpLearning.Optimization,"Primary change is the addition of an `IParameterSpec` interface, that replaces the previous `ParameterBounds` type. Two concrete implementations have been added:
 - *GridParameterSpec*:  Usable when a fixed set of parameters, needs to be searched.
 - *MinMaxParameterSpec*: Direct replacement of `ParameterBounds`. used for sampling values in the range [min;max].

The addition of the `IParameterSpec` and the  `GridParameterSpec`, makes the `GridSearchOptimizer` use a similar set of bounds as all the other optimizers. This makes it easier to switch to the `GridSearchOptimizer` in scenarios where autofac or other dependency injection frameworks are used.

The addition of the `GridParameterSpec`, also makes it possible to limit the sampling of the `RandomSearchOptimizer` to a fixed set of values. For instance:

```csharp
var parameterSpecs = new IParameterSpec[] 
{
    new GridParameterSpec(1, 10, 15, 20, 25),
    new MinMaxParameterSpec(0.0, 100.0, Transform.Linear)
};
var optimizer = new RandomSearchOptimizer(parameterSpecs, iterations: 100);
var actual = optimizer.OptimizeBest(Minimize);
```

In the above, the `RandomSearchOptimizer` will only sample randomly between the fixed values `1, 10, 15, 20, 25`, for the first parameter."

Implement Coefficient of Determination (r-squared) metric,
Add ParameterType to optimization ParameterBound,"This pull request adds a `ParameterType` to the `ParameterBound` class in `SharpLearning.Optimization`. The parameter type specifies if the parameter is discrete or continous. This enables the parameter samplers used in the optimizers to sample from either a continous range or from a discrete range. Before this, all samplers would sample from a continous range.

For instance, during hyperparameter optimization of a gradient boost model, it makes more sense to sample the number of trees on a discrete range, and the learning rate on a continous range. If the number of trees is sampled on a continous range, the optimizer will try many continous values which will be cast to the same integer values in the learner. For instance 15.2325, 15.9343, and so on, will all be cast to 15. Using the discrete range will make the search more efficient.

The parameter type is specified on the `ParameterBound` class, together with the other options:

```csharp
var parameters = new ParameterBounds[]
{
    new ParameterBounds(min: 10, max: 1000, transform: Transform.Linear, 
         parameterType: ParameterType.Discrete), // iterations
    
    new ParameterBounds(min: 0.001, max:  0.2, transform: Transform.Logarithmic, 
         parameterType: ParameterType.Continuous), // learning rate
    
    new ParameterBounds(min: 1, max: 25, transform: Transform.Linear, 
         parameterType: ParameterType.Discrete), // maximumTreeDepth
    
    new ParameterBounds(min: 0.5, max: 1.0, transform: Transform.Linear, 
         parameterType: ParameterType.Continuous), // subSampleRatio
};
```

The default value of the `ParameterType` on `ParameterBounds` is still `Continous`, so the default behavior of the optimizers will not change.

Most implementations of IOptimizer don't properly pass on the random seed to all internally used algorithms,"Hi mdabros,

I love the Optimizer classes of SharpDevelop, I use them heavily for hyperparameter tuning.
But I would like to use differend random seeds and parts of the Optimizer classes don't allow using them like that.
Example:
If you look at the constructor of your BayesianOptimizer you can see that it doesn't pass on the ""seed"" parameter to all other classes that BayesianOptimizer creates instances of, sometimes it will just forward a hardcoded 42 instead. 
I know, 42 is the answer, but I would prefer ""seed"" in this case... ;)
The other IOptimizer implementations have similar issues.
Would be nice if you could modify that some time... 

Thank you!

Fix the non-deterministic behaviour of the random forest and extra trees learners when running multi-threaded.,"This pull request will fix the non-deterministic behaviour of the random forest and extra trees learners. It will also ensure that the learners produce the same models when running single threaded and multi threaded.

The main changes to the learners are:
 - The random generator used for each tree is created before the learning process starts.
 - Each random generator is associated with a specific tree index.
 - The final order of the learned trees is made using the tree index.    

This pull request should solve issue #65 and is related to the previous pull request on that issue: #66 "
correct random seed problems in random forest learners,fix bug described in #65 
Random Forest: m_random and parallel RNG,"Hello, I would first like to thank you for making such an excellent and accessible repo. We're getting quite a bit of use out of it in multiple projects.

I've noticed that despite setting the seed in the Random Forest learner, I get slightly varying results from run-to-run given identical inputs. I suspect the problem is in the following code block:

```
Parallel.ForEach(rangePartitioner, (work, loopState) =>
{
   results.Add(CreateTree(observations, targets, indices, new Random(m_random.Next())));
});
```

The parallel random number generation is a problem; the same random numbers are generated because the seed is set in the constructor, but there is a ""race"" between the threads to grab the next random number. Locking m_random would not help, I think. This should be fixed by generating a random number for each tree prior to entering the Parallel.ForEach loop, like so:

```
int[] randomNumbers = new int[m_trees];
for(int i = 0; i < randomNumbers.Length; i++)
{
   randomNumbers[i] = m_random.Next();
}
Parallel.ForEach(rangePartitioner, (work, loopState) =>
{
   results.Add(CreateTree(observations, targets, indices, randomNumbers[work]));
});
```

Let me know if I'm overlooking something. I'd be happy to fork and make a pull request.

An item with the same key has already been added,"Hello,

Might not be an actual issue, but more of a question on how to handle my error. I want to feed data into the parser that is in the SharpLearning.InputOutput.Csv package. Below is my code:

`string rawTarget = Transformations.ReturnColumnAsCSVString(Data, OutputColumn);

System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard.SetText(rawTarget);

var targetparser = new CsvParser(() => new StringReader(rawTarget));

var targets2 = targetparser.EnumerateRows(OutputColumn).ToF64Vector();`

So, first I pull my data into a string, this results in a string looking like this:
`""Vwap"";7049.4;6983.3;6981.8;6871.0;6846.7;6811.0`
(obviously there is a lot more)

Then I use the Stringreader to read my string and parse it to an F64 vector.  The error I get is:
`An item with the same key has already been added.`

I have also tried to convert the string to a stream, then use the Streamreader but this results in the exact same error. I am at a loss at how to solve this. 

Hope anyone can provide a solution! Thanks in advance!

Strongly-named assemblies,"First, let me say thanks for the great package: it works much better in our app than our previous (non-learning) solution.

We've got one issue to report: in our next release, all the various subsystems need to be in signed assemblies, which means we can't at the moment use SharpLearning since it would need to be called by a signed assembly and is itself unsigned. Any chance we could see signed versions of the SharpLearning Nuget packages?

Thanks,

change unsafe code to safe code,
Add support for enabling/disabling messages from learners during training.,"Currently, some of the learners in SharpLearning will output information during the training period. This includes the early stopping with gradient boost and neural networks. It should be possible to enable and disable these messages, and preferably, also possible to choose where the messages should be outputted. For instance to  `Console`, `Trace`, or alternatively a log file. 

This could be made by adding an `Action` to receive the message. This should probably be part of a separate interface, for learners supporting this. Something like:

```csharp
public interface ILogger
{
   public Action<string> Log { get; set }
}
```

The learners would then add the message to the log. Likewise, other algorithms like the optimizers could also implement this interface."
OutOfMemory Exception in F64Matrix constructor - maximum array bounds exceeded,"Hi there!

First: Thanks for the great work, excellent design you have there!

I am experiencing an OutOfMemory Exception in the constructor of F64Matrix that does not really come from memory shortage but from the fact that F64Matrix internally uses a single one dimensional double array that can quite easily exceed .NETs internal boundaries of maximum array dimensions.

In my case I tried to create a F64Matrix with 10 mio rows and 55 columns.

My preferred suggestion would be to either abstract the matrix to an IF64Matrix interface that probably only consists of the At() method overloads. This would enable users to provide a custom implementation that is capable of handling larger amounts of data, if needed even by swapping data from and to disk.
Another solution could be to change the internal implementation of F64Matrix to use an array of double arrays, which I believe could also help.

Thanks for your help and keep up the excellent work!

Best regards

Add ParameterBounds and hyper-parameter scale transform to optimization ,"This pull request adds a ParameterBounds type to optimization to make it more clear to the user how to setup min and max bounds for the optimization parameters. This is illustrated below:

```csharp
var parameters = new ParameterBounds[]
{
    new ParameterBounds(min: -10.0, max: 10.0),
    new ParameterBounds(min: -10.0, max: 10.0),
    new ParameterBounds(min: -10.0, max: 10.0),
};
 ```
Note that the `GridSearchOptimizer` still uses jagged arrayes for defining parameter ranges. This is intended since a grid search typically invovles outlining all hyperparameters for the grid, and jagged arrays fits this purpose nicely.

It is now also possible to add a scale transform to the sampling of the hyper-parameters. This can be usefull when dealing with hyper-parameters like learning rate, that covers a large range close to zero, like 0.0001 to 1.0. In this case it would be better to sample using the logarithmic scale to get a better distribution of values across the entire range. Default transform is linear, and logarithmic scale can be applied like illustrated below:

```csharp
var parameters = new ParameterBounds[]
{
    new ParameterBounds(min: 100, max: 300, transform: Transform.Linear),
    new ParameterBounds(min: 0.001, max: 1.0, transform: Transform.Logarithmic),
};
 ```

Running the hyper-parameter tuning example from [SharpLearning.Examples](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning.Examples/blob/master/src/Guides/HyperparameterTuningGuide.cs) before and after introducing logarithmic scale for the learning rate and subSampleRatio shows improved results:

**With linear scale**
Train error: 0.0174 - Test error: 0.3905

**With logarithmic scale**
Train error: 0.0011 - Test error: 0.3843

This will solve issue #57 .


"
Optimization: Add option for how to sample hyper parameters,"Currently, all optimizers in SharpLearning.Optimization use random uniform sampling for sampling hyper parameters from the provided min/max boundaries. This is not always optimal, for instance when dealing with a hyper parameters like learning rate that can span a large range of values, like 0.0001 to 1.0. Using random uniform sampling in this case might result in only sampling values in a small part of the range. In this case it would be much better to sample at uniform in the log space. Hence, it should be possible to select which space to sample from for each hyper parameter when setting og an optimizer. 

This should include at least random uniform form:
 - Linear (current method)
 - Logarithmic
 - Exponential

At the same time, setup of the hyper-parameter ranges could be changed from setting op an array of arrays to using a type to guide the user better:

**Current method**
```csharp
var parameters = new double[][]
{
   new double[] { 80, 300 }, // iterations (min: 80, max: 300)
   new double[] { 0.02, 0.2 }, // learning rate (min: 0.02, max: 0.2)
};
 ```

**Proposed method**
```csharp
var parameters = new OptimizerParameter[]
{
   new OptimizerParameter(min: 80, max: 300,  SamplingMethod.Linear), // iterations (min: 80, max: 300)
   new OptimizerParameter(min: 0.02, max: 0.2, SamplingMethod.Logarithmic),, // learning rate (min: 0.02, max: 0.2)
};

Add cntk python simple mnist examples,"As a starting point for simple python mnist example using cntk, copied the original example from [cntk](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Examples/Image/Classification/MLP/Python/SimpleMNIST.py)

@nietras Currently, the simple mnist example from CNTK is quite different from corresponding example in Tensorflow. We should decide how much we want to modify the CNTK example, and/or the tensorflow example, to make them as similar as possible.

 - The CNTK example uses text files as input and tensorflow the raw data.
 - The CNTK example also uses the Dense operator from the layer API.
 - The CNTK exmaple uses all 60k examples for training and tensorflow only 10k."

0.26.7.0: TimeSeriesCrossValidation,"With most time series data, it is not possible to use traditional cross-validation methods, like the CrossValidators available in SharpLearning. The reason for this is, that shuffling the data will result in the learner and model using future data to predict past observations.
While it is possible to use the NoShuffleTrainingTestSplitter to create a single split without chainging the order, this will limit the size of test set and for smaller datasets reduce the robustness of the test set error/generalization error.

For this reason, this pull request introduces the TimeSeriesCrossValidation<T> class. Time series cross-validation is based on rolling validation, where the original order of the data is kept, and new observations in the test interval are predicted as hold-out samples and following included in the model one at a time. A nice illustration of this can be found here: [Cross-validation for time series](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/). 

The TimeSeriesCrossValidation<T> class supports the following features:
 - InitialTrainingSetSize: Specify how much data the initial learner/model should use.
 - maxTrainingSetSize: Specify a max size for the training interval. If no max size is specified, this will correspond to an expading training interval. If a max is specified, this will correspond to a sliding training interval.
 - retrainInterval: Specify how often the model being validated should be retrained. If no interval is specified, the model will be retrained each time a new time step is predicted and included. If an interval is specified, the model will only be retrained at the specified interval and the existing model will be used for validation predictions inbetween the retrain intervals.

More information can be found in the documentation of the code and the unit tests.

A short example showing how to measure the mean square error using The TimeSeriesCrossValidation<T>class:

```c#
var tsCv = new TimeSeriesCrossValidation<double>(initialTrainingSize: 30);

// Calculate the validated predictions.
var timeSeriesPredictions = tsCv.Validate(new RegressionDecisionTreeLearner(), observations, targets);
// Get the targets corresponding to the validation predictions. 
var timeSeriesTargets = tsCv.GetValidationTargets(targets);

// Measure the mean square error
var metric = new MeanSquaredErrorRegressionMetric();
var mse = metric.Error(timeSeriesTargets, timeSeriesPredictions);
```

Improve SequentialModelBasedOptimizer (now BayesianOptimizer),"While attending the NIPS 2017 conference I was lucky enough to have Frank Hutter, the author and co-author of several [Bayesian Optimization papers](http://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/hutter/publications.html), explain me some insightful details about this type of optimization.

This pull request contains improvements to the SequentialModelBasedOptimizer, now renamed to BayesianOptimizer, based on some of the insights provided by Frank Hutter.

The main changes are:

- Model type changed from RandomForest to ExtraTrees. The important change here is how the split in the decision trees are calculated. RF: (v1 + v2)/ 2 vs. ET: random * (max - min)  + min, where random is between 0 and 1.
- Optimizer type for finding the maximum of the acquisition function changed to RandomSearchOptimizer. This should matter less, but compared to the ParticleSwarmOptimizer, this seemed to work better in practice.
- Refactored the BayesianOptimizer to be easier to extend with other model types, optimizers and acquisition functions in the future.
  - Currently the model type, optimizer type and acquisition function is hardcoded:
    - Model type: ExtraTrees
    - Optimizer type: RandomSearchOptimizer
    - Acquisition function: Expected improvement
  - A natural extension would be to make it possible to inject other types. Like a Gaussian Process instead of the ExtraTrees model and so forth. These changes will be included in a later pull request.

I ran a small test to illustrate the improvements, optimizing the hyper parameters of a classification decision tree learner on the [landsat satellite dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(Landsat+Satellite)) from UCI. As can be seen on the attached image, the updated BayesianOptimizer uses significant less function evaluations compared with the old implementation (SequentialModelBasedOptimizer), and the RandomSearchOptimizer, while also finding a better minimum.

Change to unified project versioning,"After the migration from .net framework/desktop to .net core, I decided to switch to individual versioning for each project in SharpLearning.

Better error messages from learners in case of dimensionality mismatch,"Currently, there are no checks to verify that the dimensions of the observation matrix and the target array matches before learning is started.

This parameter should also be introduced in the AdaBoostLearners ([ClassificationAdaBoostLearner](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/blob/master/src/SharpLearning.AdaBoost/Learners/ClassificationAdaBoostLearner.cs) and [RegressionAdaBoostLearner](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/blob/master/src/SharpLearning.AdaBoost/Learners/RegressionAdaBoostLearner.cs)), to have more possibilities for reguralizing this type of model .

In the RandomForest implementation of this feature, there is sampling with replacement, even if subSamplingRatio=1.0, this is part of the algorithms design. However, for the AdaBoost implementation of this feature, if subsampling is off (subSampleRatio=1.0), no sampling with replacement should be introduced, and the whole training set should be considered in each tree of the ensemble. This will result in the 'classic', AdaBoost algorithm, if the subSamplingRatio is set to 1.0. 

Besides the difference when subSampleRatio=1.0, the AdaBoost implementation should be very similar to the RandomForest implementation, which can be found here [RandomForest](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/blob/master/src/SharpLearning.RandomForest/Learners/ClassificationRandomForestLearner.cs)."
AdaBoostLearners: Add features pr. split as regularization hyper parameter,"RandomForest and GradientBoost learners have a hyper parameter, featuresPrSplit, which controls how many randomly selected features are considered during the decision trees search for a new split. This parameter should also be introduced in the AdaBoostLearners ([ClassificationAdaBoostLearner](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/blob/master/src/SharpLearning.AdaBoost/Learners/ClassificationAdaBoostLearner.cs) and [RegressionAdaBoostLearner](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/blob/master/src/SharpLearning.AdaBoost/Learners/RegressionAdaBoostLearner.cs)), to have more possibilities for reguralizing this type of model .

Sine the DecisionTreeLearner used in adaboost already supports 'featuresPrSplit', the implementation should simply add the hyper parameter to the adaboost learner contructors and forward the parameter to the DecisionTreeLearner."
Better default parameters for DecisionTreeLearners,"Currently, the DecisionTreeLearners ([ClassificationDecisionTreeLearner](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/blob/master/src/SharpLearning.DecisionTrees/Learners/ClassificationDecisionTreeLearner.cs) and [RegressionDecisionTreeLearner](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/blob/master/src/SharpLearning.DecisionTrees/Learners/RegressionDecisionTreeLearner.cs)) does not have very good default parameters. With a maximumTreeDepth=2000, using the default paramters will, in most cases, result in a model that overfits the problem. Hence, a better set of default paramters should be found, that, in more cases results in a better regularized model."
Replace SharpLearning.Containers.Matrices.F64Matrix with multidimensional array,"In SharpLearning, the F64Matrix class, which is part of the [Learner interfaces](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/tree/master/src/SharpLearning.Common.Interfaces), is mostly used as a container for holding the features for a learning problem. While SharpLearning does contain some [arithmetic extensions](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/tree/master/src/SharpLearning.Containers/Arithmetic) for the F64Matrix, the arithmetic is not used by any of the learners. Also, more efficient implementations can be found in [Math.net](https://github.com/mathnet/mathnet-numerics). 

Therefore it might indicate, that the primary container for features in SharpLearning should rather be a standard .net type like multidimensional array (double[,]) or jagged array (double[][]), with some extension methods to add the current functionality of the F64Matrix. 

An alternative, also suggested in #6, would be to replace the F64Matrix directly by using Math.net as the matrix provider. However, since only the SharpLearning.Neural project is using matrix arithmetic and with the plan of using [CNTK as backend](https://github.com/mdabros/SharpLearning/issues/9), math.net is a large dependency to take, if only using the matrix class as a feature container. So currently, I am leaning more towards replacing F64Matrix with a standard .net type. However, to better handle integration between Math.Net and SharpLearning, maybe a separate project, SharpLearning.MathNet, could be added with efficient conversions between Math.net and SharpLearning containers (both copy and shared memory). This of course depends on what data structure ends up replacing F64Matrix, if any.

These are my current thoughts, and people are very welcome to discuss and pitch in with suggestions.

CNTK as backend for SharpLearning.Neural,"The Microsoft team working on [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK) has recently released the initial version of the C#/.Net API with support for both evaluation and training of neural networks. A more feature complete version, with support for layers and other helpful features, should arrive before the end of the year. Currently, there seems to be a few performance related issues (https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/issues/2374 and https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/issues/2386) but hopefully these will be also be solved in the next release.

Using CNTK as backend for SharpLearning.Neural will add operators for more layer and network types, while also enabling GPU training and evaluation. Using a well supported deep learning toolkit as backend will also help to ensure that future operator, layer and network types will be available faster.

This task will require a large rewrite of SharpLearning.Neural, most likely only keeping the top level interface. However, since all the core operations are availible from CNTK, most of the hard work is already completed.

This task should be split into multiple others when a design of how CNTK should be integrated has been completed. A few considerations:
- Should the integrations be ""simple"", i.e. only have a NeuralNetLearner and NeuralNetModel in SharpLearning and use the layer construction and related functionality from CNTK directly?
- Should the integration hide CNTK behind an adapter to make it easier to support other deep learning toolkits like TensorFlow(Sharp)? "
.Net Core and .Net Standard support,"Add .NET Core and .Net Standard support to make SharpLearning available on more platforms. Porting to .Net Standard involves the following tasks:

- Retargeting the projects .NET Framework version to .NET Framework 4.6.2.
- Determining the portability of the code using API Portability Analyzer. This has been done, and only the GenericXmlDataContractSerializer from SharpLearning.InputOutput uses unsupported API calls.
- Change the implementation of GenericXmlDataContractSerializer to conform with .net standard 2.0. This is possible with the available API calls, however there are issues with serializing some of the Math.net containers used in the NeuralNet models. This might be solved together with #9, since CNTK will most likely replace math.net in the SharpLearning.Neural project.
- Change project format to .net core.

After the porting process the continuous integration on appveyor must be updated."

Math.NET Matrices,"This is a really great library. Was there a specific reason why you chose to roll your own Matrix class, rather than leveraging Math.NET?

Ideally I'd like to marry the two (not only for consistency with modules I've already written, but even for smaller things like using Matrix<float> rather than Matrix<double>). Before I jump in and start changing anything, though, I thought I'd check with the author to see if there was a specific reason behind it.

Questions about the output layer of the pose interpreter network,"Hello, after reading your paper, what I understand is that the pose interpreter network is to output the position and orientation of 5 objects at once, so we need to set the final output of the network to be 5×3 positions and 5×4 orientations. (Take 5 types of objects as an example).

But after looking at the code of the pose interpreter network(pose-interpreter-networks/pose_estimation/models.py: line 68-75), I found that the logic of this network is that the network inputs a mask of one object and the corresponding object id. The network first outputs 5×3 positions and 5×4 orientations, and then determines which one to choose as the final predicted value according to the object id. In the end-to-end model(pose-interpreter-networks/models.py: line 45-55) number of times the pose interpreter network runs is equivalent to numbers of objects segmentation network output. 

When training this network(pose-interpreter-networks/pose_estimation/train.py: line 111-118), only 3 positions and 4 orientations are compared with the target value, which is equivalent to the remaining 4×3 positions and 4×4 orientations are meaningless. (I don't know if my understanding is correct)

If my understanding is correct, then why does the final output of the network need to be related to the number of object types , can it be directly set to output 3 positions and 4 orientations?
If my understanding is wrong, I would appreciate it if you could explain the posture interpreter network。

Problem in training the segmentation network using the provided dataset,
Pose estimation has huge position and orientation error for one object and does not appear to decrease,"Hello,

So I generated my own training set and am attempting to train the pose estimation portion with just one object, I was able to go through all the steps to get the CAD model properly setup, the PCD files and do all the stuff with the redis-server. I ended up attempting to train the model, and after 3000 epochs, I find the error is quite large, roughly the same as what it was at the start (37889.62 m for position, 127.81 m for orientation). Any advice on what I might be doing incorrectly?

end_to_end_eval position estimation (own dataset),"Hey there,

Do you have any idea why it is estimating the position an the small pictures right, but on the masks it is getting from the segmentation network wrong.

Issue with Segmentation Eval 403 Forbidden,"Hi Jimmy,

I have downloaded the pretrained datasets, however when I attempt to run the segmentation eval Jupyter notebook. I receive an error in the third block. It seems that the code is downloading a checkpoint from a princeton website. Attempting to visit this site gives me a 403 Forbidden error. The address is: https://tigress-web.princeton.edu/~fy/drn/models/drn_d_22-4bd2f8ea.pth. 

Do users need special permission for this?

Problem about evaluation with my own dataset,"Hi, Jimmy.

I use my own dataset which contains one object and I trained it, I had problems because my images hadn't the same size as others images used for models pretained, so I changed the train code and it worked. But now I have problems when I try to use eval.ipynb, at the line model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['state_dict']) I have this error :

Problem about pose_estimation training with my own dataset,"Hi, Jimmy.

I use my own dataset which contains one object to train the pose estimation. When I ran train.py there is the error : 
RuntimeError: invalid argument 2: size '[-1 x 40960]' is invalid for input with 2768896 elements at /opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1535491974311/work/aten/src/TH/THStorage.cpp:80

I went in the debug mode and I found that the problem is that the matrix x in models.py file at line 52 don't have the right size. Normally I should have matrix of shape [32,512,8,10] but I have [32,512,13,13] when I look x.shape. I don't understand how this matrix is created and so where does the problem come from. 

Could you give me any suggestion?

Thanks in advance."
Problem about orientation_error of validation set is extremely high compare to train set.,"Hi!
I used my own dataset which contains four objects to train the pose_interpreter_network and I found the orientation_error of val dosen't decline well when error of train set converged as the chart below.

![火狐截图_2019-05-07T11-28-27 356Z](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38148405/57296727-44d10b00-7100-11e9-9665-a0cd94afaaa1.png)

Consequently, the result of end_to_end_eval is unsatisfactory as well. Despite the positions of object are predicted correctly, most the orientations are wrong.
Could you give me any suggestion?

“parser.set_defaults(process_val=False)  # should download provided val set to match numbers in paper”
Where to download val set??
I set process_val=True to create val dataset ， but when I train my pose estimator：

Issue about  training pose estimation models.,"Hi, Jimmy.
When I ran 

> python train.py config/floating_kinect1_mask.yml

There was a error

> File ""/home/huo/virtuallist/py36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pypcd/pypcd.py"", line 282, in point_cloud_from_fileobj
> if ln.startswith('DATA'):
> TypeError: startswith first arg must be bytes or a tuple of bytes, not str 

came out.

It seems because of loading pcd file incorrectly. I have tried to use the two fomat of pcd file in binary and ascii, but the same error still occurs. And if I modified the code `ln.startswith('DATA')` with `ln.startswith(b'DATA')`, there will be a error 

> File ""/home/huo/virtuallist/py36/lib/python3.6/re.py"", line 172, in match
>     return _compile(pattern, flags).match(string)
> TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object

come out subsequently.

Could you please give some adcices to solve the peoblems above?
Thank you."
Segmentation training issues: StopIteration,"HI! Thank you for the great job.
I created a json file of my own annotated data by following the coco mask.py.

Then I modified the config file(drn_d_22_ChargePile.yml) and utils.py related to the object classes in ""segmentation"" folder.
But when I run

There is a error ""StopIteration"" came out at:

It seems my dataset wasn't loaded correctly.
Can you give me any suggestions about how to solve these problem？Thanks."

blender in pose estimation,"Hello, when I run the demo, visualization, and evaluation code in ""pose estimation"", the program has been rendering in the background of the blender, unable to proceed to the next step, and there has been no result. I encountered this problem for the first time and put the “mesh” folder in the Oil Change dataset. The permissions of the .stl file in the file are changed to executable files, which can run normally. 
However, after a few days, I met the same problem that the program has been running can not produce results, I don't know how to solve this time."
