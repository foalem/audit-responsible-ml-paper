So, can you help me out? Thanks a lot. "
Data Structure to train based on CFPD dataset,"Hi! I am trying to use the repository with the CFPD dataset. I currently have all the images in a single folder, but I am not sure how should I distribute them in training, validation and test folders based on the .mat file.

I made some changes but I am having this error in the 311 line in FCN.py
ValueError: Cannot feed value of shape (110, 224, 224, 3, 1) for Tensor 'annotation:0', which has shape '(?, 224, 224, 1)'

Do you know what could be happening? How can I have the image tensor with the right shape?

Thank you!"
