iOS: add interactively swipe right anywhere on the screen to return to the feed list,"In a comment on the #1720 (grid view) issue, @samuelclay requested:

> I'd like to interactively swipe right anywhere on the screen to return to the feed list. This should be an interactive gesture across the entire width of the view.

I replied:

> that is already available as an edge swipe. Which is distinct from a non-edge swipe, which changes story pages.

Since it's unrelated to the grid view, I've created this new issue. Though I'm still unclear on it; as I said, swiping from the left edge to the right will go back, and swiping right within the content will go to the previous story. So you want a swipe right within the content to continue to go to the previous story if ended before the right edge of the screen, and go back to the feed list if it reaches the right edge of the screen? I don't see how that could be interactive, since it'd be paging the stories then suddenly stop doing that and switch views? Can you show a video of another app doing this elegantly?"
iOS: Total count is double feed/folder sum count,See this thread: https://forum.newsblur.com/t/total-count-on-ios-app-is-double-the-sum-of-the-feed-folder-count/10077
iOS: Offline images aren't displaying,"They work in story previews, so I know they are there, but they are broken in stories and look like broken images. Only happening when in airplane mode."
Android: Scroll jumps on load of new items,"I've encountered this bug in the Android app for ages, and I'm finally reporting it. Sorry if it's been reported elsewhere — I looked but didn't find it.

## Summary:

Using the Android app, while scrolling through All Stories, on-screen list position occasionally jumps when new items are loaded.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have many feeds from news sources that add new items frequently.
2. Go to All Stories.
3. Slowly scroll down the list. No need to click on any items.
4. Continue slowly scrolling down the list until new items are loaded at the top of the list.

## Expected Result:
No visible change. At any point in scroll, there are certain specific items on-screen. When new items are loaded at the top of the list, it should not change which specific items are on-screen.

## Actual Result:
List of items visually jumps, making you lose your place. Suddenly you're looking at completely different items than you were just a moment ago, before the new stories loaded. The items that were previously on-screen are now off-screen.

## Versions:
App Version: 12.1.1
Android Version: 12"

Add Apple App Store badge to the README.md,"Hello,

I am a happy long time user of the iOS NewsBlur application. I wanted to add the Apple App Store badge to the `README.md` so that others know you can use NewsBlur on Apple mobile devices too.

- Add a clickable badge for the NewsBlur Apple App Store page

- Use Apple's marketing website tool to get the App Store badge
  - https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app/463981119

- Used HTML elements `&nbsp;` to add left padding to the Apple badge so that it aligns with the F-Droid badge. GitHub restricts what kind of inline styling is allowed in the README.md for security reasons. Inline styling of padding left is one of those attributes that get removed.

All feeds are currently publicly accessible via their numeric feed IDs, making it easy to enumerate and access feeds added by other users. This situation violates users' expectations of privacy and security. Access to some RSS feeds should be limited to the user who added them, as they are meant to be private.

This issue has been raised in previous forum discussions:

- https://forum.newsblur.com/t/feeds-are-not-private-anyone-can-see-any-feed/4579
- https://forum.newsblur.com/t/private-feeds-are-public-for-everyone-to-see/2490

For information on potential exploitation, see https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Forced_browsing.

## Proposal

Treat feeds with fewer than N subscribers as private, requiring authorization for access. Limit access to existing subscribers, similar to email newsletters. If the number of subscribers exceeds N, the feed can revert to the current public behaviour. The value of N could align with the threshold for a feed's appearance in search results.

Here's a small diff to illustrate the proposed solution:

```diff
diff --git a/apps/reader/views.py b/apps/reader/views.py

iOS: Native share sheet not working,See this thread: https://forum.newsblur.com/t/ios-native-share-actions-not-working/9926
Android: Allow scrolling the stories list in pages,"Assuming one actually reads only <5% of the stories, most of the items in the list will be scrolled over without reading. NewsBlur already partly serves this use case by auto-marking stories as read during scrolling. But this scrolling currently takes more effort than necessary. Either one needs to move the finger all the way up (basically grab the bottom-most item and drag it to the top of the screen), which requires a second hand. Or one can do many smaller scroll moves with the thumb of one hand, but then that thumb will eventually suffer from RSI. Or one can fling-scroll and catch at the right moment -- but missing the right moment means accidentally marking many stories as read, which would be bad. What's more, none of these scrolling solutions work particularly well while walking (when phone and hands aren't stable).

Possible solutions:
1. Introduce a new pagination mode where a single upwards drag/gesture scrolls a whole page (like the Page-Down key on a desktop browser). Feedly has this.
2. Add Page-Up and Page-Down buttons at the bottom of the screen, overlaying the list, analogous to the ""previous story"" and ""next story"" arrow buttons at the bottom right when viewing a story.
3. Introduce another value for the ""Mark read on scroll"" setting, so that there's ""Leave unread"", ""Read on scroll"" and ""Click to mark read and scroll"". The latter changes the behavior when tapping an item. Instead of opening the story, it will be scrolled up past the upper boundary of the screen, thereby marking it and all stories above as read. To open a story, one would long-click it.

The third proposal is a little less intuitive, but more powerful than Feedly's solution for power users: Because it's not tied to whole pages, it allows the user to interrupt their reading/skimming even halfway through the list, by simply tapping the item they just read. This is opposed to Feedly, where there's only the option to mark the whole page as read, or nothing."
Android: Put feed name and date/time on one line,"At least in ""Spacing: Compact"" mode, the feed name and the timestamp should be put on a single line, to save vertical space:

![Screenshot_20230227_215537_NewsBlur](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2501211/221683628-f12c2455-839b-4644-9d2b-f35e699fec66.jpg)

Here, half of the vertical space is spent on non-content stuff. E.g. the ""Golem"" and ""21:31"" bit can both be above or below the title. In the case where there's also an author (not sure if that happens a lot, I saw it [here](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/1639#issuecomment-1059319457), but it never happens in any of my feeds) that could also be squeezed onto the same line, or simply be omitted in compact view."
Android: Add show hidden stories button,"On Web, there's a setting at the top right: ""Show/Hide hidden stories"". The equivalent doesn't seem to exist in the Android app, which just always displays all hidden stories -- which defeats the point of having ""hidden"" stories in the first place.

So my feature request would be to add such a filter to the Android app as well."
[Self Host] cannot access from lan with iOS app,"hi there, I tried to install NewsBlur with docker compose.

The installation looks good, it seems accessing the page by lan ip from another computer does not work, it will redirect me to `localhost`, which does not make much sense as I'm on another computer. 
but as mentioned in other issues, I followed readme and added a custom (fake) url: `mytest.com` and added that to my local dns record. Now I'm able to open the page on my other computer with `https://mytest.com`

BUT if I try to put this custom url in iOS app, I get similar result as this one:
https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/1552#issuecomment-962604629
> I am self hosting also. The iOS app crashed for me on the first launch. After running a second time and updating the custom domain URL, I just get a blank screen and it says offline. I am able to access the URL fine from Safari.

For me the app will not crash after changing the url, but there will be a icon/message saying ""cancelled"", then everything is just empty, and app says offline.

I tried the testflight link in that issue and obviously it's expired since it's been quite a while.

BTW 
- I followed readme to install, no other proxy/reverse dns involved.
- and my iCloud private relay is turned off

Hope I can get some help here, thanks in advance!"

iOS: Xcode cloud,Let's hook up NewsBlur Dev to Xcode cloud so I can get regular branch builds on my device
jhh,
Test,
"Backend: newsblur.log grows forever, needs rotation","I noticed that the newsblur.log did not appear to be honoring its maxBytes setting in settings.py. I believe the fix for this is to add backupCount into that log stanza. 
Example:
        'log_file':{
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'class': 'logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler',
            'filename': LOG_FILE,
            'backupCount': 5,
            'maxBytes': 16777216, # 16megabytes
            'formatter': 'verbose'
        },"
Multiple changes to enable running on AlmaLinux 8 with podman and some Youtube RSS fixes,
Android: Sync Login page with device theme,Before the user logs in there is no way to know his/her theme preferences and the login page is always white regardless of the OS theme. Sync the login page with the device theme.
Android: Story list is shuffled when many items have the same timestamp,"Sometimes when I read through the stories of some feed, when I come back to the story list, I see an animation happening that reorders a whole bunch of stories. This leads to a situation where, despite having ""Mark read on scroll"" enabled, there are suddenly dozens of unread stories above the scrolling fold,, but also already some unread ones below it, so I need to scroll back up to read the ones that were shuffled up there.

All the stories that got shuffled have the same timestamp. (Many news outlets that also sell print media will publish a whole chunk of articles at a scheduled time early in the morning.)

I'm not exactly sure yet what the trigger is. I navigate away from the list to read an article (sometimes in the external browser) and then I come back. So any of the following might be happening in the meantime:

1. `onStop()` and `onResume()` triggered on the Activity.
2. Entire app killed (JVM terminated) and restarted when I come back.
3. Server sync (triggered by schedule or because the local data exceeds a certain staleness).

Is there may be some unstable sort somewhere?"

fixes issues with subdomain hosting of user blurblogs,"This is a super simple fix for the problem I outlined in [this forum post](https://forum.newsblur.com/t/what-is-the-container-endpoint-middleware-used-to-connec-to-the-public-blurblog/9783). Instead of looking at the current host and checking to see if there is exactly 2 periods.. I am saying if there are 2 or more then just return the first split is presumed to be the sub (maybe sub sub) domain that we care about. 

It works for me with the NewsBlur being served at `news.mydomain.com`, but I could imagine this working with even more nested sub domains.. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Option for email other than mailgun,"Maybe I'm blind or something, but it seems like there's no option for a free-tier anymore with Mailgun. Are there any alternatives I can use instead that the system supports? I couldn't seem to find anything from the documentation that exists.

Apologies if I missed it."
What is the container/endpoint/middleware used to connec to the public BlurBlog?,"First thanks and awesome stuff going on here! 

But I recently deployed BlurBlog locally. I had to make a few modifications to make things work with my preexisting proxy (Traefik). Those were pretty basic.. I just removed the SSL redirects from the `haproxy` and did the necessary subdomain adding in the `settings.py`.  Then I point Traefik to the HAProxy and the site works*. The one thing that doesn't work and isn't honestly a big deal but its not working and so its going to drive me insane until I figure it out and fix it, is the BlurBlog. I don't know what the correct middleware should be. if I send all subdomained traffic toward the HAProxy I get the login screen or my feed (if I'm logged in). 

When I go to the Profile section where it shows my BlurBlog URL it will sub sub domain the url with my username. So if my username was `username` and my page was surved at `news.mydomain.com` and I attempted to view my BlurBlog by going to `username.news.mydomain.com` I am taken to my feed (presuming I am logged in). Then if I click on the `Profile & BlurBlog` settings menu. It shows my blog being at `username.username.news.mydomain.com`. 

This would make me think that the HAProxy or maybe NGINX isn't doing something correctly. If I make traefik route to port `81` (the port exposed for NGINX) I have a bad day and get 404s and other problems.. "
local (lan) rss' aren't working,"heya i just discovered git-web and would like to add a repository's rss feed to my newsblur, but i'm getting the error:
`This address does not point to an RSS feed or a website with an RSS feed.`
despite the url appearing to point to an rss feed..
is this perhaps because it uses standard browser authentication asking for a username and password?"

Setting up using Nginx Proxy Manager,"Trying to self host newsblur in Unraid. Setup is done by ssh into unraid, so can't check using https://localhost/. 
Basically:
1. git clone https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur.git
2. bash ./utils/custom_domain.sh newsblur.customdomain.xyz
3. amend docker-compose.yml changing the ports for haproxy: - 13080:80 - 13443:443
4. add subdomain ('newsblur') to ALLOWED_SUBDOMAINS in apps/reader/views.py (this was done after reading #1711, somehow missed this instruction the first time around. 
5. make nb

The rest of the ports are unchanged: nginx at 81:81, newsblur_web at 8000:8000

Thinking the part that I am left confused is which port to forward using nginx-proxy-manager? 8000?

Have been reading these to attempt to resolve my setup:
1. #1711
2. #1761 - Thinking this might be the most related question, though no reply there yet so nothing to be used as reference
3. #1715 - it was mentioned here to not use port 8000, but not sure how it applies to my situation here.

Autofocus controls scroll the river of news,"In recent times, the Hacker News feed has included stories that are essentially links to GitHub pages. These pages include buttons with the ""autofocus='autofocus'"" attribute set. Here's a look at the markup for one of these buttons:

```
<button autofocus=""autofocus"" class=""flash-close js-flash-close"" type=""button"">
      <svg class=""octicon octicon-x"" height=""16"" version=""1.1"" viewBox=""0 0 16 16"" width=""16"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"">
    <path d=""M3.72 3.72a.75.75 0 011.06 0L8 6.94l3.22-3.22a.75.75 0 111.06 1.06L9.06 8l3.22 3.22a.75.75 0 11-1.06 1.06L8 9.06l-3.22 3.22a.75.75 0 01-1.06-1.06L6.94 8 3.72 4.78a.75.75 0 010-1.06z"" fill-rule=""evenodd"">
</path></svg>
    </button>
```

This autofocus attribute forces my river of news mode to scroll down to it. As a side effect, every unread story from the point I was reading to this story gets marked as read (which is highly annoying).

It would be great if NewsBlur could somehow disable autofocus elements (though I could imagine this is a browser problem)."

The command does not exist in Debian/Ubuntu, so make returns an error & that line does nothing.

It looks as if the command may be present & used in Apple installs, so a conditional test using lsb_release (lsb_release -i) might be the right way forward?

Mixing `datetime.now()` and `datetime.utcnow()` may cause surprising comparisons,"[`datetime.now()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.now) and [`datetime.utcnow()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.now) both return _naive_ (non-timezone-aware) `datetime` instances. Comparing instances from the two can produce meaningless results unless the server happens to be running in UTC.

referencing the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.utcnow):
> **Warning** Because naive `datetime` objects are treated by many `datetime` methods as local times, it is preferred to use aware datetimes to represent times in UTC. As such, the recommended way to create an object representing the current time in UTC is by calling `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.

The NewsBlur code seems to use both functions, with no obvious pattern:
- [hits for `datetime.datetime.now()`](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/search?q=%22datetime.datetime.now%22)
- [hits for `datetime.datetime.utcnow()`](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/search?q=%22datetime.datetime.utcnow%22)

Of particular concern, we can see calls to both in the same module, in particular [`apps/reader/models.py`](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/blob/master/apps/reader/models.py).

I didn't see any calls to `datetime.now()` with a `tzinfo` argument."

iOS: Sometimes read stories are sent in to the backend dozens of times a second,"I'm not sure what's causing it, but often I'll see an individual iOS user's app submit the same read story hundreds of times.

Is this related to sending in read stories after returning online? Anyway, let's audit this part of the code to fix it, it's happening a fair bit. I think eventually the user hits a non-200 status code and then stops, but that can take quite a while."
Web: Closing story using keypress x should scroll story list back to title,"Hi devs, thank you for this amazing project, I really enjoy the features you bring!

There is one thing about the way how story closes in either list or magazine view that bothers me a lot. Imagine I have 10 stories on my screen right now in list view:

1. xxx
2. xxx
3. xxx
4. xx
5. xxx
6. xxx
7. xxx
8. xxx
9. xxx
10. xxx

I clicked on No. 2, the story expands. I read it half way (assuming 7 lines), lost interest, want to resume browsing, so I hit keyboard X. The story closes, but they focus does not go back to item No. 2. It will go to item No. 9, because the story closes but my scroll persists, because I scrolled down 7 lines, the screen is now located on Item No. 9. 

I really enjoy the way it works on android, I browse through headlines, and click on whatever I like, when I am finished reading, I can go back to the headlines.

I could be missing something here since I am new to newsblur. In that case, please enlighten me, and I apologize for the unnecessary issue. 

Also it would be great to have a way to close stories using only mouse!"

Thanks for newsblur, I have only been testing it for a few days, but seems really awesome!

I am testing it on an old laptop that I have for ""self hostings"", and elastic search seems to pop up every 30 seconds and cause massive cpu usage!

Is there a way to, without disabling elastic search, but to relax the schedule? I haven't even used the search functionality, so I don't care if ""search is very up to date"".

Android: Folders start closed then pop open,"From a user's email:

> I do have v11.3.1, but I'm still seeing the issue.  I force-closed NewsBlur to get a proper test, reopened it, and all the folders were closed.
> 
> For what it's worth, I opened it a minute later, without any force-closing first, and saw that the folders were initially closed but they quickly popped open without any action on my part.  Another force close saw them already open.  A third left them closed.  I can't figure out any pattern.

Can we make it so the folders are open/closed when they are initially drawn? "

iOS: Add Tag context menu attached to Add Tags button on already saved stories is too short ,"When saving a story on iOS and adding a tag, the context menu that appears is far too small and hard to use. It's near impossible to navigate if you're adding a tag to a story you already saved. You have to drag your finger in a precise spot in order to scroll through the menu. It doesn't seem like the gray box is a search box, so you can't use that to get to the tag you want to use quicker. This bug makes it extremely hard to use Newsblur on my iPhone.

We've had highlighting on the web for a couple years now and it's getting more popular. Let's add the ability to highlight text in a story and highlight it. 

On the backend, highlighting is the same as saving a story with the highlight text saved in an array. The hard part is finding the highlight again, but the good news is that it's all in JavaScript and can apply well to the wkwebview. 

I'm on mobile now so I can't point out the code but take a look at the highlight js and see if you can reason how to integrate it."

Android: 2022 Redesign,"It's time for this year's design changes. There's a good number of them.

You can see the redesign on beta.newsblur.com.

* Story titles changed the most
  * There's now a lot more margin and spacing between title, content, and date/author
  * Author moved from inline with title to next to date, losing color differences
  * Read stories are now bold, so unread and read story titles take the same space
  * Unread indicator and feed favicon switched positions
* All new icons. 100% SVGs, all found under `media/icons/nouns/*` on the `pro` branch
* Missing favicon icon also replaced (world.png -> world.svg)
* Almost all uppercase is now in regular, sentence case. Exceptions can and should be made, but buttons and such are now ""Sentence case"".
* Feed title background colors are slightly different to match each other better
* All feed favicons now have a border radius
* Blurblogs move to below a user's own feeds
* All menu icons (site menu, feed menu, folder menu, story menu) were replaced
* New icons in Feed Options popover (top style menu)
* Difference between Comfortable / Compact was further emphasized
* Borders between feeds, folders, and story titles were removed and deemphasized
* Story content header has fewer borders and more space
* Feed header bar no longer has borders, just the gradient
* Story action buttons at the bottom of each story are slightly different too
* Highlighted feeds have a border radius and margin to them now

I uploaded a whole bunch of screenshots of the before and after from the web for convenience, but realized it would be easier for you to just switch back and forth between beta.newsblur.com and www.newsblur.com. That should help guide the relative changes since it won't be a 1-for-1 with mobile.

But the spacing around the title should be normalized. And bring the unread indicator up to the top line of the story title to match the web.

I uploaded a whole bunch of screenshots of the before and after from the web for convenience, but realized it would be easier for you to just switch back and forth between beta.newsblur.com and www.newsblur.com. That should help guide the relative changes since it won't be a 1-for-1 with mobile."
Refreshing RSS feeds on iOS & iPadOS,"Hello,

I wanted to suggest possibly a new way of refreshing RSS feeds in the background even though your app has been force quit.

I would like to draw your attention to the following list of alarm clock apps:
Alarm Clock Pro by Handy (Notifications)
Alarm Clock - Alarm & Weather by Handy Inc (Notifications)
FlipClockPro by 翠玲施 (Notifications)
Loud Alarm Clock ULTRA by Infinite Wave Media, LLC (Notifications)
Alarm Clock: Music Sleep Timer by DylogicApps Pt Ltd (Notifications)
Alarm Clock Pro - Music, Sleep by DylogicApps Pt Ltd (Notifications)
Alarm Clock Radio Plus by Philip Bailey (Notifications)
Alarm Clock Radio by Philip Bailey (Notifications)
Nightstand Central Alarm Clock by Thomas Huntington (Notifications)
Alarm Clock for Me - Wake Up! by Apalon Apps (Notifications + Background App Refresh)
Alarm Clock for Me by Apalon Apps (Background App Refresh)

So there is a mix of alarm clock apps with either:
notifications
background app refresh
notifications + background app refresh
and with all these alarm clock apps you can set an alarm, force quit the app, lock your screen and then when the time comes an alarm is sounded and a notification is displayed.

Would it be possible to duplicate this functionality? So your RSS app sets an alarm and when it is woken up it checks/updates/refreshes the RSS feeds and sends a notification if there are any new items in your subscribed RSS feeds but no alarm sound goes off just a normal notification sound and then your RSS app automatically sets the next alarm to repeat the process. The alarm interval or in this case the refresh interval should be able to be set by the end user.

Kind regards,
Cooper"
iOS: Optimistic premium upgrade,"To address the issue of Apple's servers sometimes not sending payment receipts until a few minutes later, let's optimistically upgrade ios users who complete the payment flow successfully. 

We have the `/profile/save_ios_receipt` endpoint, so let's reuse that. Use the same `product_identifier` and use `in-progress` for the transaction_identifier. The backend will take care of duplicates (within 3 days)."
feed filtering?,"Hi I used the try out thing with Newsblur.
I'm missing a function to pre-filter feeds for some keyword. E.g. show/add only news from this feed with 'Obama' in title.
Does Newsblur support this? Did I missed it? Is it planed feature?"

"""Remote end closed connection without response"" exceptions when trying to automate writing API data to a file.","So I wrote a Python script to automate writing multiple pages of a feed (from `/reader/feed/:id`) to a file, and it worked fine several days ago. However, since yesterday I've been experiencing these exceptions and I can't figure out what's wrong. I don't know if it's the server cutting me off, something wrong with my script, or if there's an error with the requests module.

This is my script. The feed I'm trying to get is a subreddit feed, if that helps.
```
import requests
import json
import time
session = requests.Session()
login_payload = {""username"": ""NylaTheWolf"",
        ""password"": ""password""}

with open(""2022-05-19 Newsblur test.txt"", ""w"") as f:
    for page_number in range (1,31):
        response = session.get(f""https://newsblur.com/reader/feed/1090346?page={page_number}"")

iPad: Scroll performance on story titles,"Looks like the marking read on scroll action is what's causing a scrolling performance issue. See the video. It's smooth up top, so maybe we can queue up the read stories? That entire action has to be in a background thread, so is it the transition needing to draw a new state?

Fix strict JS error during folder moves,"At the moment on the live site, folder moves produce the console error `Uncaught ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable folder_view`. This change repairs folder moves to work in strict mode."
UI is too low-contrast,"In dark mode, the greys are way too light, making much of the text illegible to my eyes. The background could be a pure black, or close to it."

iOS: don't fetch feeds when opening notifications,"I'm finding that tapping on a notification when I haven't been in the app for a while (and so it has to load my feeds) takes a really long time.

1. When entering a category and clicking on the first story, it's always blank:
![screenshot_2022-03-22_07:45:51](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81436/159474950-e891df98-be37-4dae-902f-724f5a8fd26a.png)

![screenshot_2022-03-22_07:46:02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81436/159475106-06cb8778-0ed8-4d26-8da8-a3f3fc62a002.png)

3. When clicking a story and opening an external browser then going back to the app, clicking the next story fails to show it and instead scrolls just kinda half way:
![screenshot_2022-03-22_07:46:27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81436/159475292-6610ac9e-f22b-42ce-a27a-51a4ebb1e8e3.png)

4. Not shown in video, but when logging in for the first time, the text color of the username and password fields are invisible. Probably just black text on a black background, probably need to detect if a dark theme is being used and make sure to set the text color to something bright. I've actually typed in text to the username and password fields in this screenshot:

If you turn on `Scroll horizontally` then the first issue above goes away, but the same scrolling problem happens when leaving the app and coming back and picking the next story, but now it's on the left side:
![IMG_0302](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81436/159477892-9745b155-3ba7-4300-9c64-e1563f398506.PNG)

These issues happen always, every time.

I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, same issues.

Been a paying customer now for 10 years, since 2011, quite happy with Newsblur. Hopefully these issues can be resolved. Let me know if you need additional information."

Backend: Active Sessions,"Show list of devices and applications that are logged into your account.
Along with #1647 (2FA) this is also another security feature request useful to keep track of your logged in devices.
In case you logged in a private/outdoor device temporarily & forgot to logout there then currently there are no ways to logout from that device besides having that device physically, which I feel is really insecure.

- Show ""Active Sessions"" (IP, location & browser or app version for each logged in device)
- Option to remove them from any of your logged in device.

Backend: Two-factor authentication (2FA),"Newsblur isn't just a Newsreader. From our read articles, likes (intelligence trainer), notification preferences it can reveal everything from a person’s political and religious beliefs to sexual orientation and medical conditions etc...

I'd suggest to add 2FA extra security for Newsblur accounts as 2FA very common these days & easy to setup.

- Enable/disable 2FA feature according to user choice.
- (if enabled) To login you need both password & authentication code from your authenticator app
- (if enabled) To disable two-factor authentication, you need your password and an authentication code from your authenticator app.
If you lost access to your authentication codes, you can also do a password reset via email.

"Delete Saved & Read stories with ""Erase Yourself""","NewsBlur should remove all Saved & Read stories when you ""Erase Yourself"".

Currently it just remove all sites which is expected as you click on ""DELETE ALL OF MY SITES"" but when someone tries to erase himself I assume he wants to remove all his traces including Read & Saved stories. (of course without deleting his account)

This should show on your NewsBlur > ACTIVITIES as a message that you Erased yourself.

Feedly [does these landing pages better](https://feedly.com/i/subscription/feed/https%3A%2F%2Ffeed.ctrl.blog%2Flatest.atom); showing logged-in the feed in the default interface with a big follow button, and showing a custom preview page with sign-in or sign-up to follow for users who’re not yet signed in/up. Twitter’s intent links are [another good example](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=CtrlBlog) with a clear step-by-step flow for logged in and new users to engage with what’s linked.

In both these examples, the site’s UX and messaging explains what the service is (to new users), and what action is about to happen (following someone/-thing through the service), and helps them login or sign up, and to complete the follow-action. The flow is preserved even if you need to take a step aside to sign up to a new account, click an activation email, install and open an app, or whatnot.

Newsblur has a goodie-link, e.g. `https://www.newsblur.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffeed.ctrl.blog%2Flatest.atom` but it only works when you’re logged in. Even when you’re logged in, it’s easy to miss the little dialog that opens in the bottom left corner of the screen. (Especially when on a large screen.)

Newsblur should also have a better onboarding flow when linking new and existing users to a feed on Newsblur.

This may seem harmless, but if an article gets unstarred from elsewhere before the client becomes aware of it, it creates a condition where the client thinks it needs to retry because of server issues.

I believe this just started happening within the past week or two. Starring an article that is already starred appears to work as expected."

Backend: Docker asset pipeline seems broken,"## Context
I have been self-hosting NewsBlur for a few months and wished to upgrade my local version to the latest version available (basically HEAD of the master branch).

Upon restarting, my local instance would crash as it could not access the asset `css/common.css`.

I managed to find a solution for my use-case but I am opening this ticket as an FYI if it turns out there is actually a problem and it's not a simple user error 🙂 

## Problem(s)
To solve it, I tried to: 
1. Run `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/srv/newsblur newsblur/newsblur_deploy` (that I saw in the Makefile)
=> It failed as it couldn't access the binary for `google-closure-compiler-java`.

2. Make sure the setting `DEBUG_ASSETS` is set to `True` as it should mean that collecting static files manually isn't required (as I understand it).
=> It had no impact, the instance would fail with the exact same error about `css/common.css`.


## Potential solution(s)
1. Setting the closure binary path to the one used in `newsblur/newsblur_deploy` worked for me, not sure if it's a dirty fix though.
I changed`'CLOSURE_BINARY': '/usr/bin/java -jar node_modules/google-closure-compiler-java/compiler.jar'` into `'CLOSURE_BINARY': '/usr/bin/java -jar /usr/local/bin/compiler.jar'` in `newsblur_web/settings.py`.

2. No idea, didn't look too much into it. My guess is that it's a problem with my installation but hard to tell.

iOS: Search long-press opens Infrequent Sites Stories and not All Site Stories,"![IMG_E6D993A10D5B-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44229/154296928-865114fc-a565-40bb-80a8-520bfd5c4489.jpeg)

iOS: Don't reload feeds until an hour has passed since user last used app,"Right now the way it works is that the feed list will refresh (and by extension, on ipad, the river of news will also reload) if you return to the app more than X minutes (I think 10? 60? It's in the default.pch file) after the last feed refresh. 

Problem is that if you are reading the river for more than 10 minutes and then go to another app briefly (like Safari, or even just pulling down notifications), when you return, you not only lose your place in the story but also in the story list. 

So let's change it so that the timer begins when you leave the app. Probably storing the last used date on app losing focus and then comparing against that. 

Alternatively, do in fact refresh the feed list if it's been more than 10 minutes. But don't refresh the river.

The real answer is to do the same thing as the website, which is use websockets and update the feed list in real-time, using periodic feed list refreshes to fix any stale counts. But that's for another ticket."

iOS: River from widget only loads a few stories and then shows the story titles end bar,"I believe this is due to how the river calls the backend. There is a story list cache that NewsBlur keeps on the backend for about an hour for each river call. But you have to call every parameter the same except for `page` in order for the cache to match. When it doesn't match, then we get a story titles end bar. 

Honestly, I think it's just the feed list we pass to the river that needs to be the same. NewsBlur uses a hash of the list of feed ids to identify the story list cache key. 

Two options:

1) Transfer the stories from the widget for instant load, and then page through the river as though starting from the first story, and tossing new stories that come in that match the already displayed stories. And that means stories may appear slightly out of date order. That's ok.
2) I believe right now we're transferring the stories and then continuing to page? Fewer network calls, but can easily break the feed cache in the river."

myne does indeed incorrectly show <Site: localhost>

how do i fix this?

- newsblur_web/docker_local_settings.ph has the subdomain set for NEWSBLUR_URL and SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN
- config/fixtures/bootstrap.json has the subdomain set as the domain

* Manual means a new ""Mark story read"" button, basically the same button as the Share/Save/Train buttons, but full width, above those three. 
* Hitting that button changes the text to ""Read"" and a slightly dimmer text color.
* Tapping it again marks unread, and restores text to ""Mark story read""

And we should also do the timer, so if you remain on a story for more than X seconds, it auto-marks as read. Nifty!"
iOS: Auto-select first story,"On iPad, we are now showing the first story but not marking the story as read. I think the behavior we have now is not the right behavior, as it shows a story, you read it, then you swipe to the next story, and the first story isn't read. I don't think there's a good way to let the user mark the story as read by default but then have a way to unread it. And that made me realize that the unread should be manual, and that's basically a ""auto-select first story"" feature.

iOS: Preference for marking story as read only after time or manually,"Issue: When I'm reading a long item (in either Story or Text modes) over several days (which means I'm going in and out of the app many times), Newsblur marks the item as read before I've completely read the item. This occurs because Newsblur has no sense of how far I've scrolled within an item. (At least, I believe it doesn't — sometimes it saves my position when reopening an item, but other times it starts me from the beginning. I haven't been able to figure out why this behavior changes.)

Request: Add an option to track scroll percentage within an item when in Story or Text mode, and only mark item as read when passing that percentage threshold.

* I return to NewsBlur, but it’s no longer on the “Share this story” screen with the large text box containing all the text I had been typing. It’s instead showing the article view, but with the keyboard from the share screen still displayed on the bottom half of the screen.
* because the keyboard is still displayed, I can’t actually scroll back down to click the “share” button again until I get rid of the keyboard

So I thought I could look into supporting it.

We have the story sharing panel in the app, with buttons to share to Twitter and Facebook. I could add a third button to share to Micro.blog, or perhaps to Micropub. It'd display a web view to authenticate, similar to Facebook etc. I had a quick look, and found some code to help with posting."

curl --request POST --user ""<username>:<password>"" http://newsblur.com/api/login'

{""code"": -1, ""errors"": {""username"": [""Please enter a username.""]}, ""result"": ""ok"", ""authenticated"": false}

```
curl --request POST --user ""<username>"" http://newsblur.com/api/login

Enter host password for user '<username>':
{""code"": -1, ""errors"": {""username"": [""Please enter a username.""]}, ""result"": ""ok"", ""authenticated"": false}

I was told I needed to work with my cookies. I've tried exporting my cookies but to no avail.

```
curl -X POST --cookie-jar session.newsblur --data ""username=NylaTheWolf"" --data ""password=<password>"" https://www.newsblur.com/api/login 

{""code"": 1, ""errors"": null, ""result"": ""ok"", ""authenticated"": true, ""user_id"": 625613}

curl POST -b ""C:\Users\Nyla Smokeyface\Downloads\newsblur_cookies.txt"" https://www.newsblur.com/api/login 

{""code"": -1, ""errors"": {""method"": ""Invalid method. Use POST. You used GET""}, ""result"": ""ok"", ""authenticated"": true, ""user_id"": 625613}
```

So...I'm completely lost here. I haven't really used curl before so I don't know if it's something super obvious and I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but I have no idea how to work with this API."

inside my lan, the custom subdomain reaches my newsblur instance, but redirects to 10.0.0.26 (the lan ip of that machine).

Android: Images are decoded without checking image size,"When loading an image, Google suggests us to resize the image before decoding them, so as to save memory resource.
https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/load-bitmap.html

However, in the code below, images are decoded by decodeByteArray() directly without checking image size:
com.newsblur.activity.FeedSearchAdapter.java onBindViewHolder()
https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/blob/master/clients/android/NewsBlur/src/com/newsblur/activity/FeedSearchResultAdapter.kt#L30

Are these images all of small size and do not need to be resized? 

Also, onBindViewHolder() is performed in the UI thread, which means image decoding is performed in the UI thread. Because image decoding is of high time consumption, you can perform these operations in worker threads (e.g., via AsyncTask).

In addition, Google suggests us to cache the bitmaps that can be reused, so as to keep a fluid and fast-loading UI.
https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/graphics/cache-bitmap.html

onBindViewHolder() are frequently invoked and this means that there will be many bitmap objects being created if we not define a cache to store them. For performance considerations, maybe you can define memory cache to store the bitmap objects. Then app can reuse them instead of creating new bitmap objects continuously."

I tap a notification but the story hasn't yet been loaded into NewsBlur's offline cache (which is reasonable to assume as it's a new story), so newsblur loads the cached version of the feeds stories and then runs the find story check, which never completes because the story isn't there.

iOS: Finding story HUD has weird animation,"See the video. This happened because I tapped on a NB notification outside the app, came into the app and loaded the correct feed, but the feed didn't update and so I saw this HUD appear over and over again. I believe that issue is covered in #1568, but I want to fix the animation on it. 

Also, we need to keep the finding story routine specific to the feed for which it is being used. In this video I opened a different feed and newsblur is still trying to find a story it won't be able to find. Just a feedid check to correspond with the find story I'd check.

iOS: story titles image preview doesn’t show until scroll gesture is finished,"In other words, when scrolling, image previews aren't loading u t I lift my finger. See video.

Backend: Support paginated RSS feeds,"On the site https://jrs-s.net/ only a few posts are parsed from the feed (feed is at https://jrs-s.net/feed/), though other posts are present in the rss feed, they are just on subsequent pages, like so: https://jrs-s.net/feed/?paged=2

Is there a way to fix this so I can properly read paginated feeds?"
How to get YouTube feeds working on docker?,"Youtube feed get added as untitled and show no articles.  Tried several links and get the same result for all.  Tested the one below in another app and it displays as expected.

https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCZNhwA1B5YqiY1nLzmM0ZRg"
Only able to login via https://localhost,"I am only able to login using https://localhost.  When I try to login via https://192.168.1.106 I get redirected back to the login page.

Here is what I have tired
```
updated NEWSBLUR_URL and SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN in docker/local_settings.py to IP address
updated DOMAIN in config/fixtures/bootstrap.json. to IP address
updated NEWSBLUR_URL and SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN in newsblur_web/docker_local_settings.py to IP address
docker exec -it newsblur_web bash
  python3 manage.py makemigrations
  python3 manage.py migrate
make rebuild

Is there another step I am missing?"
iOS: Recently muted site unread count still shows up in total count,"Not sure if this is the correct place, but I've found an issue with the ios app (or possibly a feature?) 
When I mute a site on the web application in my browser, the total unread articles is updated to remove the number from that unread site (I've done this on feeds that gather too many articles, but still are nice to have if I want to read one day). 

However in ios they still appear in the total unreads, and this is quite frustrating as it doubles/triples my number of unread articles and discourages me from reading. 

I understand this may not be the best place to post or that this issue is difficult to fix. 
If so let me know how I can help. 

## To test: 
add a site
mute the site
total unreads should not reflect the count from the unreads for the muted site

Android: Not being able to login (self-hosted & official website),"Hi,
I have not been able to login to the Android app. I have tried a self-hosted environment as well as your official website, and yet still, every time I try to login via the application, I obtain the following:

""Logging in... Retrieving feeds...""

And then I receive the: 
""There was a problem logging in to NewsBlur""

I tried to do a little of my homework, but I'm not sure how to check the logs. I ran it on an Android Studio on a Manjaro distribution, and from there, I was able to access the official server, not my self-hosted instance, and then I tried the official server again, and it didn't work anymore. I tried to check #1439 and #1356, but none of them seemed to work. I went on F-Droid and tried installing the v10.3, but that did not work either. So yeah, the only instance I was able to get it working was on an Android Emulator via Android Studio, and only to the official server (once). I have a Pixel 3a running an Android 11 with the Kernel 4.9.248-gc4689af91bc5-ab7425221.

I also have tried to use the beta version of NewsBlur on the Play Store after I have cleared my cache from the Play Store app and Webview app. Perhaps it's also important to note that, on my self-hosted instance, it is behind a HTTP protocol, and not a HTTPS. Not sure if that makes any difference. *shrug in confusion*

Do you have any tips? Thanks!

Docker: Cannot login when website is accessed from other machine in LAN (not localhost),"Hello, 

I am trying to setup a self-hosted Newsblur instance on my Ubuntu 20 server (using docker) and I am having some difficulties. 

I am using the Makefile commands and while the installation works as expected when accessed from the server itself (accessing it through localhost), it does not behave the same when accessed from another computer on the same LAN.
On that other computer, I can load the homepage but the authentication has no effect (it redirects back to the homepage). 

My educated guess is that the session cookie is set for the domain localhost and is therefore useless when Newsblur is accessed through its host's LAN IP.
I have attempted to replace localhost by the LAN IP in `docker/local_settings.py` and `config/fixtures/bootstrap.json` without success, the cookie is still set for localhost.

I would love to have your input on what are the correct steps to take to enable access with a domain other than localhost. 

Thank you!"

An aspect I'm undecided on is if it should take into account the user preferences on which rivers are visible?
On the one hand it would be nice if the numbers matched the listing in the sidebar.
On the other that complicates both the code and possibly muscle memory if Newsblur or the user changes.

Backend: YouTube Playlists Not Actually Resolving All Changes,"## Version

https://beta.newsblur.com/

## Problem

The YouTube Playlist functionality doesn't always fetch all new items in the playlist. For some feeds it only returns the first five items.

## Debugging

YouTube Playlists can be sorted one of five ways:

* Date added (newest)
* Date added (oldest)
* Most popular
* Date published (newest)
* Date published (oldest)

Additionally, videos in a playlist can be manually reordered by the playlist owner.

I don't believe it is possible to override the return order when reading a playlist. This property is set at the discretion of the playlist owner.

I am not familiar with the NewsBlur codebase but I believe this code is responsible for resolving YouTube Playlists:

```py
if list_id:
    playlist_json = requests.get(""https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems?part=snippet&playlistId=%s&key=%s"" %
                               (list_id, settings.YOUTUBE_API_KEY))
    playlist = json.decode(playlist_json.content)
    try:
        video_ids = [video['snippet']['resourceId']['videoId'] for video in playlist['items']]
    except (IndexError, KeyError):
        return
```
(From: https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/blob/master/utils/feed_fetcher.py#L285)

The [Google API documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlistItems/list#parameters) suggests that by omitting the `maxResults` parameter you'll only receive 5 results.

Based on the above code, this is how Newsblur handles different playlist sort orders:

* If the playlist is set to _Date added (newest)_ AND there hasn't been more than 5 videos added since the last scrape; Newsblur will correctly add all new videos.
* If the playlist is set to _Date published (newest)_ AND the playlist owner never adds older videos to the playlist AND there hasn't been more than 5 videos added since the last scrape; Newsblur will successfully add new videos.
* If the playlist is set to _Most popular_ Newsblur will only ever add a new video if it makes it into the top 5 most popular on the playlist.
* If the playlist is set to _Date added (oldest)_ or _Date published (oldest)_ then Newsblur will never detect new videos.
* If the playlist is manually sorted then it'll be down to luck!

## Reproduction

Backend: Group by feed,"Surprised I haven't prioritized this, but we should have a group by feed in any `river_stories` endpoint. It would work with `order`, but instead would be a `order=feed-newest` and `order=feed-oldest` and stories would come out grouped by feed. 

The order for the feeds should probably match the order for the stories, so we can run a normal river_stories query, then run a parallel grouped by feeds query. The first query doesn't need to load the stories but instead can just live in redis. Once those story_hashes are in a temp redis sorted set, we can re-order with feeds grouped."

Web: Limit full-bleed images on desktop,"The new full-bleed image feature is neat, but there are a number of cases where it makes things look awful. Below are a few examples of single-panel comic strips that look quite pixelated with this new feature (and one screenshot showing one such comic image at its native size).

I could imagine a few possibilities for improving this experience:

1. The full-bleed state could only activate for images above some (configurable?) width (e.g. if the image is larger than 1000 pixels, stretch it).
2. Constrain full-bleed width to some multiple of the original image size (i.e. only allow the image to grow to 2x its original width).
3. Allow the **story width** option to be feed-specific, not global. I'd love for some sites (comic strip feeds) to be constrained to 700px, but other sites (photo blogs, for example) I might want to span the whole screen.

I realize everyone may not browse the web at full-screen, but I do, and this new feature makes some images simply too big.

Unable to Mark Stories as Unread,"I have one particular feed that is behaving strangely. The feed URL is: https://www.ncbirdingtrail.org/feed/

I added this feed (which is new to me) to my account, and all the pre-existing stories were marked as read. I typically browse in the river of news mode, showing only unread only, sorted oldest to newest. As a result, it appeared as if this feed had no stories to view.

I changed my view to show all stories, and I am able to see the stories in the feed just fine. However, if I try to mark any of the stories as unread (by pressing `[U]`), they immediately get marked as read again. See the screenshot below for what's happening.

Android: Full bleed images,"iOS has had this and I just launched it on the web. It's always a bit tricky to implement, but the relevant CSS changes can be found in this commit: b4ade7afc08b4366543d7b182a357248551f7ae2

Part of how full bleed images work is that on page load, we check every image after it loads and see if its width is greater than 320px and its height is greater than 50px, and if so add a ""NB-large-image"". If not, add a ""NB-small-image"". The JS code for this lives in media/js/newsblur/views/story_detail_view.js:watch_images_load:L132. You'll need the imagesLoaded library, which is at media/js/vendor/imagesLoaded-4.1.0.js.

So there's three states here: unloaded but loading, large, and small. We do this differently between the web and iOS. On iOS, images are kept at their natural size (NB-small-image doesn't do anything, it's mainly to see that an image is small instead of large when debugging) and then grown to full bleed when loaded. On web, we do it the opposite and assume images are large (therefore NB-large-image doesn't do anything) and add NB-small-image when it's small (javascript exposes this as `this.naturalWidth`). Therefore on the web images will look great on load but will shrink when small. On iOS, images will pop larger after loading.

I believe the web version is better because I notice it less. And when an image fixes itself, it's not a big deal, just as much as an image enlarging itself. So if the cost is the same either way, better to assume the image is large."
Bug? Multiple entries for the same story,"Hi @samuelclay,

Thanks for taking a look."
Backend: reader/page/* & rss_feeds/original_story vulnerable to XSS,"These two routes are designed to display arbitrary content from websites around the world which newsblur has no control over the content. JavaScript on external site will be run under the origin of news blurb.com and able to perform actions as their Origin and cookies under that scope.

The display of content from a third party without modification appears to be a feature in news blur and in filing this bug I've tried to come up with a solution that keeps this feature.

This vulnerability is also the same reason why some pages like Github will take over the news blog page using framebusters.

I propose 3 fixes in order of effort and time required to implement.

## Short Term Fix

* Use sandboxed iframes & CSP sandbox headers while allowing scripts but not same origin not top level navigation.

This solution has the advantage of being quick to implement and secure on Modern browsers.
The downside is the code that checks if the page loaded correctly can no longer do so as the arbitrary content is running in an opaque origin.

## Mid Term Fix

Migrate the code that checks to see if we body tag contains content in the iframe to a little bit of JavaScript on every third party content page that post a `postMessage` when the same criteria is met or not.
Given that this is now operating on an opaque Origin it will have to be sent to all Origins on the page however if it is just binary data that is true or false being sent the impact is negligible.

## Long Term Fix

* Put untrusted content on another domain for example <pageid>.newsblureusercontent.com
this makes it safer on even older browsers, and by using a unique subdomain per page if somebody blocks a subdomain for containing phishing or malware or something bad it will not affect your main Domain or the rest of the content.

Android: New font options are difficult to read,"App version 11.0b1

I find each of the new font options provided in the new beta to be difficult to read for longform content. The new ""Default"" option is highly legible for titles and labels, but **not** readable for body text. (I have also tried the other listed options, like Noto Sans and so on, with little improvement.)

Can you please add back in the previous default font as a selectable option? I found that one to be optimally readable for both longform and title/label content.

Thanks! I do appreciate the overall polish in this beta!"

iOS: Stories aren't always rendering,"Got a substantial number of bug reports today on stories not rendering. I experience this too, although intermittently.

> Multiple views of a read story sometimes don’t render. Sometimes (very frequently) if the list view for a site has read items enabled and you tap into an item, navigate back to the list view, and then tap into the same story again the story text will not render. This is usually repeatable if you swipe back and tap into the same story again. Tapping into a different story from the one you were previously looking at works fine and after doing that you can view the original story again too.

Android: Add image preview and content preview options to story titles list menu,"To match web and iOS.

iOS: Inconsistent behavior with titles on bottom on iPad,"When I upgraded to the TestFlight beta on my iPad, the story list switched to being displayed on the bottom. But unlike the prior version, I can no longer drag the splitter to the bottom of the screen to switch to stories on the left.

Also, the 'full screen' button (top left of the screen, circled) does not do anything in this mode.  I can show the feed list by swiping from the left side of the screen, but I do not think this gesture is particularly discoverable; would recommend that this nonfunctional button be replaced by one that shows the story list.

I can switch to titles on the left with ""Story titles layout"" in Preferences, which I think is also not terribly discoverable, but after I do so, it causes some layout issues when I try to swipe in from the left with a ""phantom column"" as below:

iOS: Crash on opening notifications,"I just moved to the TestFlight build and notifications work again. So when I tapped on a couple I had some issues.

The first notification re-opened NewsBlur, which was on a different feed and story. So the app backed out to the feed list and then crashed.

The second notification opened NB and simply didn't open the feed.

I recommend installing the TestFlight build and turning on some chatty feeds so you have plenty of notifications in your notification history to test with. I could fix notifications on Xcode builds by using a different certificate. In fact, I thought I did fix it by setting a user profile flag that uses the other certificate, but it seems to not be working. "
Android: Scrollbars on Story Views,"**Issue**
""Recent update of the Android app no longer shows the scrollbar when reading a story, even when scrolling up or down, making it hard to get an idea of the length of a story.

If this is intentional, it would be nice to get a config to re-enable this, and even go further and always have scrollbars visible.""

Android: The speed of entering the login screen is slow,"Hi,

When I opened Newsblur in an Android device of OnePlus 6T, Android 9.0
I found that I can enter the following login screen immediately.

However, when I opened Newsblur in another Android device of Mi Note 3, Android 8.0
I found that the speed of entering the login screen became much slower and following pages will appear before entering the login screen

Data description:  “840, 840"" is the width and hight of an image.

From the obtained image data, I also found that the 840\* 840 image is repeated decoded in the UI thread.

Android suggests that the process of decoding large images should not be executed in the main UI thread. 
https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/project/android/docs/training/displaying-bitmaps/process-bitmap.html

Maybe the process of decoding the 840\*840 image should be moved to a background thread.
At the same time, the image should not be decoded repeatedly.



Thanks.

"Android: After browsing a lot of images, image displaying becomes slow","Hi, 
I opened the news list and swiped it to browse more news.

After I swiped several times and browsed dozens of news, I found that the speed of image displaying became much slower than before.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19150666/112656520-725a0580-8e8c-11eb-8dd4-b4ed0cb84047.png)

I checked the source code of NewsBlur and found that in the following code, the image cache can be optimized to improve performance.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19150666/112656632-8dc51080-8e8c-11eb-8e99-7d37aeee3ad6.png)

Code location:
https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/blob/master/clients/android/NewsBlur/src/com/newsblur/util/MemoryCache.java#L44

In the implementation, the image cache is set to a value of `Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory()/6`,
When the image cache is full, every time decoding a thumbnail image and adding the decoded image to the image cache, the image cache will remove one or more images that have a similar memory size of the added image.
This will make the image cache always full and cause NewsBlur's the memory consumption is always high, which would affect the performance of NewsBlur.

Maybe removing more images when the image cache is full or setting a reasonable size of the image cache can mitigate the memory bloat of NewsBlur.

Thanks.

which caused the variable `decodeOpts.inSampleSize` is assigned with 1.

I collected the execution trace and found that the resolution of many decoded images is bigger than 800\*800.
For example, the resolution of the displayed image below is 1200\*1186.

However, the size of the widgets used to display these images is 315*315, which means we can downsample the displayed image so as to save time consumption in image decoding.

I think what I found may be an important reason why the speed of image displaying on this page is slow.

Hoping what I found will help to improve newsBlur's runtime performance.

Thanks."

Feed has no original page. (404) on dashboard3,"Hi,

  On dashboard3, all of my feeds are showing and error on the original page view, and say ""Feed has no original page. (404)."" I've looked through the code to try and identify the issue, but have been unable to find it. Can you point me in the direction of which component I should be looking at to track this down ? Thanks."

I'd like to move off of munin and towards something that allows me to have better insight into what's happening with the infrastructure. Grafana self-hosted seems to be best from my limited research.

The role of these metrics is to have better observability on both the individual machines (disk usage is nearing 100%, disk latency has spiked, nearing OOM) and on the entire cluster (like the munin link above, #'s of feeds fetched last 5 minutes, avg time to fetch a feed / machine, celery queue sizes)"

Move WebSub callbacks to HTTPS,"The HTTP endpoint just redirects to HTTPS anyway, so let’s skip a redirect (clients may not even implement it?) and protect the integrity of the payload."
iOS: Pinch to zoom images in stories,We should have a feature where you can pinch an image and it zooms automatically in its own view controller using a view transition. I think other apps do this well and I'd like to have an intuitive interface for zooming. The View & Zoom menu item isn't ideal and we can get rid of it and move to the standard share dialog.
iOS Catalyst: buttons inappropriately enabled on iPad with no story selected,"At least the ""text"", share (wow, this icon is old…) and Safari buttons are enabled. The full screen button should also probably be hidden.

Tapping either the share or Safari buttons cause the app to crash."
iOS Catalyst: loss of functionality with tapping and holding on images,"The current release version displays a popover which allows you to zoom an image, view alt text or save an image.

The catalyst branch does nothing useful other than allowing you to drag the image.

It might make sense to build off the standard functionality if you can — it does everything except for allowing you to ""view and zoom"", which honestly I rarely use.

Maybe it would make sense to have some very basic default styling for stand-alone newsletter articles? I'm thinking about things like `body { max-width: 90ch; margin: auto; }`, to handle very wide screens, or `img { max-width: 100%; }` to make sure images don't ""jump out"" of the viewport."

"Android: Gesture navigation for ""back"" is also interpreted as a normal left swipe","Hi,

After [switching from OnePlus 5 (Android 9; virtual button navigation) to Pixel 4a](https://karl-voit.at/2020/11/15/pixel4a-migration) (Android 11, latest OS patch level) with _gesture navigation enabled_, I noticed within my NewsBlur v10.2.0 an issue that is a nasty one:

When I am within a feed and I do the gesture navigation for ""back"" (swiping to the left with crossing the display border - I prefer the right border), **NewsBlur _sometimes_ additionally(!) interprets the ""back"" action as a normal left swipe** which is mapped to ""Save this story"" at my current setup.

I noticed that behavior by finding articles in my list of ""saved articles"" which were clearly not ""saved"" by myself.

The bad thing is that the user doesn't recognize the mis-interpreted swipe action because the intended (back) action is executed as normal. Furthermore, the app executes the ""left swipe"" action many times when the ""back"" action is executed. This has different implications, depending on the current ""left swipe"" action mapped within NewsBlur.

**My expectation** would be that when the users does a ""back"" action, no ""left swipe"" action is executed within NewsBlur."

Import saved/unread Feedly articles into NewsBlur,"Hey NewsBlur team,

Spent some time looking for a way to import unread/saved articles into NewsBlur, but haven't found one. I can't be the first person with a pile of unread stuff making the jump from Feedly to NewsBlur, so I assume that there is a solution somewhere, or that there's a technical obstacle. 

If it's neither, then I could write up a script to do this. Feedly has an API and allows to export Saved articles (_Settings/Privacy and Personal Data/Take Your Data With You/Generate your personal data archive_), NewsBlur has an API, seems possible. Any advice before I start working on this?

EDIT: if it's unclear, I am talking about importing the saved articles, not the feeds. 

Cheers!"

My expectation is that when deleting the feed, the filters would get deleted too, however, when I re-add the feed it seems those filters are still applied.
If there is a long time between deleting and re-adding a feed (say, a few months or a year) it's not always clear that there are filters applied to the feed, which creates some confusion.

It would be nice to either 1) delete filters when deleting a feed, or 2) have an option to delete filters from unsubscribed feeds."

I'm subscribed to the pinboard popular feed (http://feeds.pinboard.in/rss/popular/) which uses the [taxonomy module](https://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/taxonomy/) for its topics, here's an excerpt:

In NewsBlur, these topics are recognized but combined into one single tag `coding fonts development` instead of `coding`, `fonts`, and `development`, so that individual tags/topics cannot be trained.

Is this something that could be handled from within NewsBlur, or is it something within the feed that isn't right and could be addressed by pinboard or otherwise?

iOS: Add peek preview on long press of story links,"I can't remember when it started happening but tap & holding links is not working as it should in NewsBlur. 

Tap & hold on a link in any other app in iOS  brings up the peek preview (I think it's called) of the link. It's the pop over that allows for example to share or copy the link destination. For example in Mail.app:

![405A48AC-AC0A-47B6-8BF6-E284D6505901](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/178458/99083442-3ce40800-25ce-11eb-956b-f038fc598f37.jpeg)


In NewsBlur app it selects the text like it's any other non-link text, only giving the regular text options like copy text, define, dictate etc. This is what happens in NewsBlur:

Android: In-App Browser Improvements,"Pulling this comment out from the original in-app browser thread to highlight some improvements that could be made:

> @samuelclay it's working great so far! There are just 3 areas that could be improved:
> 
> 1. I think the back button should unwind links instead of going directly back to story. But, that's personal preference.
> 2. User should be able to copy the URL of the currently viewed page (e.g. if they navigate several links deep past the story and want to extract the URL for archiving or sharing)
> 3. User should be able to tap-and-hold to copy inline links.

Android: Why use image proxy for all images?,"A very curious issue was raised by a user here: https://forum.newsblur.com/t/android-broken-images-served-through-image-proxy/8373

It looks like if you subscribe to the feed at http://feeds.feedburner.com/SlickdealsnetFP all of the images are broken on Android. It looks like the rewriting image urls to use the secure image proxy is causing the issue. I should fix the image proxy, but I'm also left wondering why Android chooses to use the image proxy for everything? The image proxy should only be used on the web for images that are http. 

On Android you can load http images just fine. So let's do that and not use the image proxy at all."

iOS: Saved searches should show on Unread and not just All,Looks like saved searches aren't visible in Unread mode and they should be.
iOS: Download info bar on feed list pops when returning to feed list,"The info bar that says stories are downloading pops into view when returning to the feed list. I imagine this was changed when the All Done bar was lowered when returning to the feed list. I like that you can see All done slide out when returning, but it shouldn't happen every time and it shouldn't bounce the info bar when returning while stories are still being downloaded."
"iOS: In full screen mode, tapping on the story content hides the feed bar","The feed bar should stay visible. While we're here, it would also be nice if the feed bar could stay pinned to the top but then scroll with the story content when dragged down. Similar to how the story traversal buttons are pinned to the bottom but then scroll with the story content when dragged up. So yes, this issue is a two-fer."

Android: Add in app review API,"https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review

Show the rating dialog after a user swipes back to the feed list from the story list."
Web: Add highlighting to bookmarklet,"Highlighting should come to the bookmarklet, of course! Should be straight-forward to implement, although the highlighting should take place only in the preview and there should be some indication that highlighting is supported in the bookmarklet since people don't spend much time in there and they would have no reason to know that highlighting is now supported."

Backend: Add original text to tweets with links,"Everybody else is doing it. When fetching tweets, just regex for a url and then run it through the text extractor, which will need a refactor to not be tied to a story. Or maybe it is still tied to a story but it's smart enough to see a tweet and know that the link to fetch isn't the permalink, which is just the tweet, but the first link in the tweet content.

One problem is that the original text needs to be added *below* the tweet, so it can't just replace the `story_content`, although that's basically what I want. This might be a front-end change, where both `text_content` and `story_content` are filled out.

We could choose to fetch the story_content dynamically as requested by users, in which case this will 100% be a front-end implementation. But then how iOS and Android and third-parties/API users get it is who knows. I don't think pre-fetching every twitter link is worthwhile unless the feed is being read, which we can check for."
iOS: Pull to refresh in feed detail,"Mentioned in #1304:

> That's because there is no pull-to-refresh in the feed detail. I suppose we could add it...

I've added pull-to-refresh there, but only for feeds, not folders, since the latter requires logic tied to the feeds list. For feeds, it basically does an instafetch."

iOS: Timestamp on widget isn't timezone adjusted,"This is working on the version in the App Store, but in a recent build the timestamps are a few hours off. I have my timezone set correctly on the web."
Twitter: add the full names on top of the screen names,"Following a twitter account creates a feed called 'screen_name on Twitter'. Each tweet is then showed as a story, with the screen name of the author given as author. The issue is that the screen names are not always very explicit, especially for retweets.

The question is to add the full name of the author in the story_author field, for example: `Nilay Patel (@reckless)` instead of only `reckless`."

Relative image URLs are wrongly resolved when feed domain is different with story URL,"The use case:

I use Huginn to generate some feeds of my own. RSS address registered in Newsblur is something like `https://huginn.example.com/users/1/web_requests/14/balabala.xml` and the articles are of cource located in another domain. e.g. https://anquan.baidu.com/article/1098. The article contains some `img` tag with relative URL path like `&lt;img src=""/upload/ue/image/20190611/1560247617514999.jpg"" alt=""8.jpg""&gt;`, and Newsblur wrongly concat the URL path with feed address, into `https://huginn.example.com/upload/ue/image/20190611/1560247617514999.jpg`

iOS: Full screen mode toolbar appears and disappears,"There are a few oddities with the toolbar in full screen mode that I'd like to address.

Can we attach the toolbar to the top of the story and have it scroll both in and out of view? It seems like it scrolls out of view but is then detached. If it were attached the entire time, it wouldn't require any changes to the scroll bar or scrolling speed. I expect the toolbar to come back when I scroll back up but instead I'm seeing some wonky behavior with it appearing and disappearing. 

What I'm trying to avoid is any bounce to the story content itself. As I scroll up and down and the toolbar disappears and reappears, it's causing scrolling to bounce around instead of directly staying with my finger."

iOS: Style newsletters for dark mode,"This is a quick issue but one that I fixed on the web and think should apply to iOS. In dark mode, newsletters should be coerced into dark mode, flipping background colors dark and text colors lights.

Android: Auto theme for OS-level dark mode,"Android added an OS-level dark mode a while back, and many apps now follow that setting instead of or in addition to their own.

iOS: widget for iOS 14,"WWDC20 has deprecated the current widget mechanism, in favor of a [SwiftUI-based non-interactive design](https://developer.apple.com/widgets/).

The current implementation is still supported for now, but is limited to the bottom of the Today view instead of the home screen on iOS 14, and will probably stop working in due course.  The widget will need to be rewritten using SwiftUI.

For NewsBlur, this shouldn't be too problematic, since it displays stories, and tapping one opens the app.  It should be feasible to reimplement that using WidgetKit. Probably not urgent; won't be able to have the widget on a home screen until this is done, but the new widget wouldn't work on iOS 13 and earlier."

iOS: Muting a site unmutes all other sites,"I muted a site from the story titles menu option and it unmuted all of my other feeds, which for me is about 400 out of 800 feeds.

Web: Attempting to view PlayFrame YouTube feed breaks in web interface,"Recently (within the last week or so), the PlayFrame channel on YouTube seems to be broken in NewsBlur.  New stories come in fine to the ""All Site Stories"" section, but if you try to click on the PlayFrame channel (I usually do this from the Saved section via the tabs at the bottom of the page), it seems to fail and reload the page.  It also never shows any stories, no matter if it's set to show All or Unread.  Other YouTube feeds seem to work fine, so something seems to be special about PlayFrame (although I can't imagine what it is).

Here's the URL of the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-7oMv6E4Uz2tF51w5Sj49w

I've tested this in both Safari and Chrome on macOS, so I don't believe it to be browser-specific.  The iOS app seems to be fine.

If you need any more specific information, let me know and I'll do my best to get it to you.

Thanks!


Steps to reproduce:
- Open NewsBlur in Safari or Chrome on macOS (probably the same issue in Chrome for Windows; haven't tested that)
- Add the PlayFrame YouTube URL to NewsBlur: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-7oMv6E4Uz2tF51w5Sj49w
- Go to the All Site Stories section
- Find a PlayFrame story and click Save
- Go to the Saved view (the four buttons at the bottom of the UI)
- Click on PlayFrame

After selecting PlayFrame, the view will reload into ""unread"" mode and no content will be visible in the stories pane.

iOS: system clock wrong color in system wide dark mode,I turned on system wide dark mode and am using newsblur in light theme but the system clock is white when it should be black. 
Web: Train on no author,"All my Steam RSS feeds for different games have duplicate stories. One story with the actual content, and another with the same story title, but the contents just say:
```
: You can find the details for this event on the announcement page [url=https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/1145360/announcements/detail/1705110618940067328]here[/url].
```
Example feed:
RSS URL: https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145360/rss
Website URL: https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145360

"
iOS: Swiping between stories is slow,"Looks like related to #1162, but I wanted to separate this out cause it felt like a different enough bug. Anyway, try swiping between a dozen stories. For me, about a third of them take 2-3 seconds of stop-the-world loading. See this video:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/v00qinopzj8ttr4/RPReplay_Final1579830224.MP4?dl=0"
Web: Search loses keyboard focus before query is entirely typed out,"I often find that the search feature will start the search before I've finished typing, making me accidentally press all sorts of keybound shortcuts.

An option to only start searching when I've hit the enter button, would fix this and make me want to use search more often."
[Request] Multiple instances of the same feed,"I'd really like to be able to add the same feed multiple times, but they would behave like like separate feeds and therefore let me have different intelligence training on them. This is especially handy for sites that tend to bunch up all their diverse content into a single feed.

This could probably also be optimized share feed fetching, since they would be sharing the feed url."
Android: Some images never load on Android,"E.g. this repro: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/arantius/888ae0fc3eca4fc42eac8cc546caf690/raw/53daebb69e6ef281765a4e06743b6e5e38424e01/dhd.xml

If i add this as a feed, the image always shows broken in the Android app.  If I long press and choose open image, it always works.  In the web reader, it always works."
"Add ""black"" theme on iOS","The ""black"" theme in the Android app is my favorite. I really miss it in the iOS app. Can it be added?"
Android: Comments don't load HTML like it does on the desktop,"Check out the public comments on today's (January 3rd) XKCD strip:

https://www.newsblur.com/site/5994357/xkcd.com

On desktop, the bot's comment shows its quotation marks as intended. But in the Android app, we see ""\&quot;"" instead of a quotation mark. And in the comments made by mburch4 and yaomtc (me), quotation marks appear as normal on both desktop and Android.

Also, the imgur link that joeythesaint posted from the desktop shows HTML around what was the link."
iOS: Crash on feed list load,"Not sure why but this is happening both on an older iPad with what looks like a stale cookie but also on my main iPhone, with a current cookie.

Here's the error: `[User Defaults] Attempt to set a non-property-list object`

I'm not getting a line, but it's after the feeds have been fetched. LMK how I can help diagnose this, since I'm reliably getting it on both devices.

Here's a screenshot of the stack trace:

iOS: replace UIWebView with WKWebView,"This was mentioned as part of the Mac Catalyst idea (#1247), but now has a fixed deadline, so I'm adding a separate issue for it.

[Apple announced on December 23, 2019](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12232019b):

> If your app still embeds web content using the deprecated UIWebView API, we strongly encourage you to update to WKWebView as soon as possible for improved security and reliability. WKWebView ensures that compromised web content doesn’t affect the rest of an app by limiting web processing to the app’s web view. And it’s supported in iOS and macOS, and by Mac Catalyst.
> 
> The App Store will no longer accept new apps using UIWebView as of April 2020 and app updates using UIWebView as of December 2020.

So we need to complete this within the next year. I'm giving it a `critical` priority since it has a deadline, and will take some time, though we have several months to complete it."
Backend/API: add a story image thumbnail endpoint,"This is a new issue to split out the request for a story image thumbnail endpoint, for use with the iOS widget (#1162):

> Okay, @samuelclay, can you please add that endpoint to take a story hash and desired size, and return the first image (if any) scaled to the requested size. Either use the smaller dimension as the size (and I'll aspect fill to cut off the extra), or have the server do that and return as a square image.

I notice issue #1241, which could also be related.

iOS: Dark theme keeps turning itself off,"Looks like this is still happening in the latest build, too. I turn on dark mode, switch out of the app, come back in, and it's light themed."
Android: image feed should use same proxy as web version,"When I open a feed on desktop, Images embedded in the port are displayed via proxy:

https://images.newsblur.com/643629380131d3ec52c0315d8d681d63fc76b8b0/687474703a2f2f61737365742d362e736f757063646e2e636f6d2f61737365742f31343438362f313539375f366265375f3430302e6a706567

When I open the same feed in Android app, images open slower and/or are often broken due to TLS misconfiguration because direct links are used:

https://asset-6.soup.io/asset/14486/1597_6be7_500.jpeg


Is there a reason why image proxy is not used on Android? 
I believe it would improve use experience a lot.

iPad: Multiple windows,"I believe this is iOS 13, but I’d like to have NewsBlur open in multiple windows. (This is the feature where you tap on a iPad dock icon while the app is already open and it switches into the window switch dialog). 

Is this feasible? Are there assumptions that the app makes that can’t be resolved with multiple windows? I feel like this would require those callback pointers that you pass between pages so you can context switch and not lose your place, but I don’t know that this is absolutely necessary. I just want multiple NewsBlur windows open side by side on different feeds. A callback pointer would be necessary if it was the same feed but at different pages, which we don’t need to support."
iOS: Tapping Safari button doesn't do anything for Macrumors stories,"From a user email:

Hi, I noticed this behavior while reading the MacRumors feed. I tapped the title of the YouTube embed to open the YouTube.com URL in Safari as one often does:

Android: Offer a re-sync mechanism,"Hi!

Android v9.0.1 here on (1) OnePlus 5 (OxygenOS 9.0.8; patchlevel August 2019) and (2) Android 6 tablet.

I'd love to see a settings function that allows me to purge my local status and **re-syncs from the web service**.

**Reason/Background:**

Currently, I'm using an Android tablet and my mobile with the NewsBlur app. I've got multiple situations where I added and removed the ""saved""-flag where the ""other"" device did not get the removal. This ended up in having the funny situation that my mobile shows 0 saved articles in the overview. However, when I enter the saved articles menu, I see dozens of saved articles. These saved articles are not listed as saved on the web page nor on the tablet.

The only thing I can do now is manually removing the synced-flag on these articles whenever I reach 0 saved articles on the other interfaces. I'd love to get rid of this manual sync if possible.

From other RSS aggregator apps I know this ""reset from server"" functionality which usually cleaned up these accumulated sync-messes. 

I know that the requested feature is a workaround to clean up the bug of being able to end up with this falsely saved articles. So far, I don't think that it's easy to reproduce and debug this issue from my point of view. I'd be glad to help, if I get directions.

Thanks!"

I have a series of links that read: Preferences / Followers / Blurblog Profile / Account / Import Site / Goodies & Apps / Notifications / Email Newsletters / Tips and Tricks / Keyboard / Organize Sites / Mute Sites / Trainer / Mark all as Read.

I did poke around in several of the likely-looking links (Preferences, Followers, Account and Import Sites, IIRC), but didn't find anything that looked like it would set me up to read something from twitter. I did see some twitter-related stuff under ""Followers"", but it didn't look like what I needed (since I don't have any friends or followers on twitter)."

Retrieving starred stories via story hash - 10 story limit,"The [documentation for the `/reader/starred_stories` API endpoint](https://newsblur.com/api#/reader/starred_stories) states that one can retrieve up to 100 starred stories via story hash per request. I am finding that if I do not specify a `limit` URL argument, I get a maximum of ten stories back.

The documentation does not mention a `limit` URL argument. My guess is that the 10 article per request limit was not intended to apply to requests for starred stories via story hash.

iOS: Mac Catalyst edition,"Now that iOS 13 and macOS Catalina introduces the ability to build iOS apps for macOS, via Catalyst, there may be customer demand for a Mac edition of NewsBlur.

I've turned on the checkbox to build under Catalyst in a local branch, as an experiment, but there are a number of issues preventing successful building of a Mac app:

- The most significant is the reliance on `UIWebView`. That is not supported in Catalyst, requiring using `WKWebView` instead. That isn't a simple transition, though: the web view is used extensively in NewsBlur, with JavaScript interactions and such, which would require many changes. It should be feasible, though. And may have to be done in due course even for the iOS app, since `UIWebView` has been discouraged since iOS 8, and is now formally deprecated as of iOS 13, in addition to being unavailable for Catalyst.

- There's an error related to using the `AddressBook` framework, but that doesn't seem to be used, so can be removed.

- There are many deprecation warnings, but those shouldn't be too hard to fix (and again will need to be addressed in due course).

Beyond those, of course, the app would need many changes to work well as a Mac app, including adding a menubar, probably some layout changes, and other UI tweaks.

But I think it could a a popular option for many people. Something to consider. Let me know if you want me to explore further.

image css modification test,continuing testing for #1222 
Android: Open story in incognito and change Copy to clipboard action to only hold URL,"One of my feeds has started using JS to scramble the page contents and sticking an overlay ad begging visitors to pay. I've found I can combat this practice by opening the link in incognito/private mode or by pasting the link into a browser with outline.com. Could this process be integrated directly into Newsblur on Android?

As an alternative, the ""Send to"" action for ""Copy to Clipboard"" should only copy the URL, not the text of the headline. At least with that I can paste directly into the outline.com site in my browser without having to paste into some text editor first."
modify css to not overflow images on chromium webview,"I think what was happening is that when a page loaded with a lot of content, the css styling could use sibling items to place images.

This shifts the image to fit within the parent bounds."

If we allow arbitrary input, something that spans title and tag (author probably isn't needed and publisher would have to be ignored), then we have also do global filters.

- ""folder1"" and ""folder2"" are gone.
- The feeds are listed in the ""feeds"" section of the response, but are not in the ""folders"" section – even as top-level feeds.

7.  Log into the NewsBlur web interface, and note that neither feed is visible.

Clearly an API client should never attempt to make one folder both a parent and a child of another, but it is possible that a client has out-of-date sync data and therefore not know about the first parent-child relationship before creating the second.

I am mitigating the risk of this in [Unread](https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/) by making a request to /reader/feeds and confirming that I am not creating a circular parent-child folder relationship before calling /reader/move_folder_to_folder, but this requires an extra server call that could be avoided if the server performed this validation."

Don't bother with manual order, but alphabetical and most used are a great idea. I believe the feed model's feed_opens attribute can be ordered (instead of just the feed_title).

After restoring the IOS app directly into the stories view, it seems to restore into a hybrid of the feeds/all stories and folder stories view. Tapping on stories on either side does nothing other than gray them out.

You can see this in a [screen recording](https://sabi.net/temp/newsblur-unresponsive-story-taps.mov) from the previous version of NewsBlur but the current Git version (27d2384cf15d36768eb940047c002a9494da612b) does the same thing."

Per https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/1137#issuecomment-509865471, this may have been to work around another issue.  I've never had issues with the prior behavior (on released versions of iOS), FWIW."

Android: Story saved on Android and unsaved on Web still shows up as saved on Android,"This has been a problem for a long time now, the way to reproduce is:

* save a story on android
* unsave it on web
* open saved stories on android
-> story still shows up in saved stories list on android
So apparently the App knows that some stories got unsaved, but are still wrongly retained in the actual list.

However, the counter has been reduced appropriately so there will be more stories in the saved story view than the number in the overview screen. Every time I unsave a story on Web that I saved before on Android, I have to unsave on Android again. This problem reoccurs after reinstalling (even though the current wrongly saved stories disappear)."

Possible workarounds:

iOS: Address memory issues causing app to be killed when in background,"People lose their story positions on a quick jump out of the app. Only memory issues can cause this I believe. So can we hook it up to Instruments and diagnose whatever is causing the OS to kill the app?

From this thread: https://forum.newsblur.com/t/ios-app-reloads-on-ipad-losing-current-story/6515/7"
Android: Autoscroll,"Like it says on 
https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/1171"
iOS: Autoscroll,"I’d love to build a feature for those exercising. I’d like to see the page auto scroll after you toggle it, per story, from the story detail view’s settings menu. Of course it should use the new full screen feature, regardless if it’s enabled for all stories. And that frees us up for a scroll speed toggle. How about a set of + - buttons similar to the story traversal buttons, and they only appear on tap and fade out after 1 sec. "
Gravatar: Uses old e-mail on front-page,"It looks like there are some bug in the calculation of the MD5 sum for Gravatar on the front-page:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116227/53103385-d5e70b80-352d-11e9-9138-d815b269b55e.png)

When looking into account settings I have the following for my mail:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116227/53103433-ec8d6280-352d-11e9-9ba8-0b7c54d0adcd.png)

I can see the Gravatar icon points to the following page:
https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e1edee6f5c779f92df32ce2723c2d07

Which is not the correct MD5 sum for my Archlinux.dk mail:
echo -n julemand101@archlinux.dk | md5sum
50b08d90afd96271299a4dc0fcf672f2  -

Instead, I can see the MD5 sum are for my old E-mail:
echo -n julemand101@gmail.com | md5sum
5e1edee6f5c779f92df32ce2723c2d07  -

The strange thing is that in the following window I got the correct Gravatar (which points to 50b08d90afd96271299a4dc0fcf672f2):

So it could seem that Newsblur does not change my E-mail in all places in the backend when I change the mail in the Account page.

iOS: Scroll performance on story titles,"Check out this video (running latest code): 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/vk3dqso7d3hj615/2019-02-14%2011.19.47.mp4?dl=0

Looks like it really only hits unread stories. But we should figure out if we can locally cache whatever is taking a long time to lookup."
Android: Record folder names as tags when saving a story,We do this both on the web and ios. Would be good to have on Android.
iOS: Small display bug on iPad when in dark mode,"Only happens when you first open the app. There's a white line that goes away if you switch themes back and forth.

iOS: Keyboard shortcut for next story skips stories when hit quickly,Try using a smart/external keyboard with the iPad app and hit down/j to traverse stories. If you hit down quickly you'll see that it skips around. This is in some brittle code (`applyNewIndex`) but if we can get `nextPage.pageIndex` set immediately then it shouldn't be a problem. But for some reason the animation is causing the pageIndex to get set too late or in the wrong order.
Backend: Multiple blurblogs,"Share a story to a shared group blurblog. Publish multiple blurblogs, separated by tags/subjects. Nice big ticket feature."
Android: Posts with block quotes showing up incorrectly,"Posts beginning with a list or block quote (and maybe others) sometimes aren't fetched properly. Blurbs in feed view properly show post content, but some comment (not necessarily the first one) or sidebar is displayed when a post is opened.

I've noticed this behavior on a few feeds, but it happens most often on Marginal Revolution (https://marginalrevolution.com/).

"Android: ""Loading..."" text but story doesn't load. Tapping out then in shows the story.","Tell us a bit about your problem:

It often happens that I open an article, but only see the text ""Loading..."" forever (or longer than I'm willing to wait). But in those cases, tapping the Back button and trying again makes the article show up immediately.

The attached log is from this sequence of actions:
- open article, see loading
- tap back button
- tap article again
- tap article title to open in browser (this particular feed is incomplete)
- switch back to NewsBlur
- hit back a few times and pull up the bug report thing from the menu

Sorry if there is too much log spam; I can make a cleaner version if needed.

The extra weird thing is that I've got Download Stories enabled and am on a reliable 50 Mbit internet connection. Even the article's preview image is shown in the article list. So whatever is""loading"", if anything, is probably not coming from the internet.

I'm an Android developer myself, so if there's anything I can do to help debug this annoyance, please let me know!

iOS: vertical story scrolling should have full screen interactive gesture to go back to story titles,So for the new vertical scroll option we launched a few months ago I’d like to have interactive horizontal gestures that let you slide the story detail view back into the story titles view. Obviously this isn’t possible with the horizontal scrolling preference.  
iOS: New option for changing height of story titles,"Add this option as a 4 part segmented control in the story titles settings menu. This allows you to increase the height for story titles to get more space for story titles and story content previews. 

4 parts:
 * 2 line title only (this is built but is exposed in a show_content_preview preference)
 * 2 line title + 2 line story content (todays default)
 * 2-4 line title (variable height) + 2-4 line story content (variable height)
 * 2-4 line title (variable height) + 2-6 line story content (variable height)

We'll have to use the new smaller thumbnail to make this work, but it should be top-right positioned, not center-right positioned."
iOS: new preference to disable all audio,"From https://twitter.com/gavinsharp/status/1074687171578064896

Hi, I’ve noticed this intermittent issue when opening links in the app on the 2018 12.9” iPad Pro. The article will open with a black box on the right, and after closing the article, the display of the feed will look like the attached until the app is restarted. I haven’t been able to figure out what the articles that trigger this have in common, but I’d say it happens about 5-10% of the time I click on a link.

Sorry this is vague! Let me know how I can help troubleshoot.

iOS: Draw story view even if images take > 1 second to load,"Right now, on slow connections, the story view takes a while to draw and is stuck under the loading spinner. This can take quite a while. This really only happens on stories that are shared. I believe the loader is waiting for the user avatars to download. But the result is that you're sitting there watching a loading spinner.

Can we make it so that the spinner takes a max of 1 second and then draws whatever is ready to go, regardless of whether or not the images are downloaded and ready to display. I don't care if it causes a repaint, if it takes longer than a second it should be fine to draw."

Android: Preference for size of image thumbnails in story titles,"Same as #1142, but for Android.

After seeing Brett Simmons' new UI and thinking about what he got right, I think that the image previews next to story titles should have a third setting (apart from on/off) which is ""Small thumbnail"", which insets a small preview instead of taking up top to bottom space (and thereby shortening the title excessively, esp. on an iPad).

Android: Bad List UX for Non-Unread-Tracked Meta-Feeds,"Capturing the long-standing issue with viewing meta-feeds (like Global Shared) that start off with stories that pass the selection filter but that get additional stories from the network that sort to a higher position and cause list jumpiness.  Since these don't have advanced unread-based cleanup, fallback cleanup handles them much less often, so UX is poor if you read said meta-feeds somewhat frequently.

Possible solutions involve improving the position-locking code in the RecyclerView adapter or more aggressively cleaning out stale stories before starting the adapter."

This is especially important as by default Redis isn't using a password, and if you happen to have this on a public IP address, miscreants from around the world will mess with your Redis instance.

2. This PR also puts as volumes the remaining configs for the different backends.

Android: UI-Service Thread-Joins in 9.0b1 Beta Release,"Our 9.X beta series implements a required target platform version bump to comply with GOOG regulations.  However, some mostly-undocumented changes to the async APIs appear to have caused some async tasks to thread-join the UI thread, causing jank.  (this is very similar to a platform change made by GOOG around Android 5.X where AsyncTasks became serialized without documentaion)

We may need to change async libraries or stop using platform-provided services hooks in order to restore a smooth UX."
Backend: Support WebSub (and PubSubHubbub v0.4),"The specification formerly known as PubSubHubbub (or PuSH) is now called [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) and is developed by the W3C.

Newsblur is currently unable to subscribe to WebSub hubs or PubSubHubbub version 0.4 hubs.

The main problem seems to be that `verify_token` was deprecated in PubSubHubbub version 0.4 and isn’t a part of WebSub either. Newsblur requires subscriptions to have this token, however.

iOS 12: Locking device while playing a video from a story over AirPlay stops the video,"Every day I save YouTube videos on my computer and iPad in NewsBlur, and every morning and evening I stream them to my AppleTV from my iPhone X via AirPlay (""Screen Sharing"", whatever it's called today).  In the past, this worked great, but with iOS 12 it seems that when the iPhone locks (manually with the side button or through the auto-lock setting), the video stops playing.  As you can imagine, this makes it hard to watch videos -- I either have to tap the screen periodically to keep it awake, or turn off auto-lock.  It's made worse by the fact that after unlocking the device, the video often jumps back a minute or two instead of continuing to play back from where it stopped.

A secondary ""issue"" is that playing video doesn't automatically go full screen.  This is minor, since I can just tap the ""full screen"" button after the video starts.  Removing that extra step would be nice, but the fact that locking the device stops AirPlay video playback is a much bigger concern for me.

Thanks!"
iOS 12:  Shared stories (Newsblur Logo) button missing,"In iOS 12, the ""shared"" button (aka the Newsblur logo) in the top left corner of the UI on the main screen is missing (indicated by the red circle in the attached image).  It appears to be a layout issue, at least on my iPhone X and iPad Pro 12.9"", as while the view animations from a story back to the main screen, it shows briefly before it disappearing again.

It's also worth noting that the activity button (the pulse graph icon on the far right) is also horizontally compressed, implying that something is going on with the layout of the toolbar.

I use this feature daily to show my wife some interesting stories I've shared, so it's an important feature to me.  Thanks!

Unread stories are prefiltered - how to see all unfiltered stories,"As it's easier to see from images here are images of NewsBlur and InoReader. In a nutshell, the Inoreader shows the correct number of unread stories, but NewsBlur does not.

Both Feed Reader are marked unread yesterday at the same time.

NewsBlur:
See the yellow stories, that are somehow prefiltered (marked as read).

It seems that the feeds are somehow prefiltered. Maybe it's marked as unread by relevance somehow? But I don't want NewsBlur doing this. How can I disable this feature and see my feeds unfiltered. Thanks."
Android: Failing WebView Loads,"Since approximately the rollout of Android 6, the system WebView component used by the app has increasingly been failing to load the HTML we pass to it.  This appears to happen across a fairly broad sample of devices, especially newer ones.

The failure can manifest in one of two ways: either the story never renders at all and the resulting viewport is zero-height, or the WebView appears to have loaded something, setting itself a height that appears correct but stays visibly blank.

Re-setting the story HTML will generally (but not always) succeed.

These failures to load do seem to be reported back to us via the WebView error hooks.  However, the error codes reported are the same as the ones used any time a single page component fails to load (such as a missing image).  As a result, the error callbacks alone are insufficient to identify the situation without a large number of false positives.

HTML blocks featuring images appear to be affected more then text-only content.

Since the WebView component provided to us varies wildly across devices and is mostly a black box, we don't have a great deal of control surface to tune or change.  I will add some investigation ideas and potential workarounds in the comments."
App: Compared to Feedly and InoReader image loading is not performant,"As the title says, this is about reading Feeds on the Smartphone app. 

I really like the small image View. All the big Feed Reader (Feedly, InoReader and Newsblur) having this view and it's pretty easy to compare how much is needed to scroll through the same Feed.

So round about I can say that the InoReader is taking the lowest bandwidth. Let me show that in a (round about) bandwidth comparison:
- InoReader 0,8 MB
- Feedly 2,2 MB
- NewsBlur 2,6 MB

Would it be possible to improve that view by serving compressed images or smaller images like InoReader does.

This is by the way the reason why I currently prefer InoReader. But I more like NewsBlur as it fits much better to my UX experience.

Thanks and hopefully it's not that hard to fix."
Web: Add preference for image preview on left,"I cannot find a way to bring the images in the List View in Desktop Browser from the right to the left side.

As You can see from the image it would be way better and would improve readability of the whole feed when look at the images besides the text instead of moving the eyes far far away.

Android: Features and Compatibility,"Finally pushing a big set of updates now that the latest release is out and happy.

* Total rewrite of the platform ViewPager adapter to address the very long-standing issues around state loss when context switching while reading stories.  After much research, it appears that we weren't the only ones struggling to use the buggy platform impl, so went off and totally replaced it.  The new one understands the nature of story rivers being a dynamic list of items rather than an fixed-indexed dataset and correctly implements state save/restore for story fragments.  In most cases, things like scroll state are now preserved when rotating or context flipping.  This also fixes the root cause of the off-by-N problems we have had for years w.r.t. actions being performed on stories but not hitting the correct story or not being immediate reflected in the UI.
* Improved messaging and display behaviour for stories/feesd that don't support original text mode.
* Inserted some addtional logging to try and help debug the buggy WebView behaviour that GOOG rolled out some time over the last few months.
* New feature - feeds can now be renamed from the app.
* Bumped the target SDK version to 26.  This wasn't to gain features, but because in a few months GOOG will begin banning apps on older targets from the Play Store as a forcing function to push people away from older platform components.  For that reason, we also had to move our sync backend to a much newer (introduced in API 21) framework that works quite differently than the original one since API 1.  This new way of launching the syncs both in the background and when joined into the foreground should be compatible with the older platform versions while simultaniously not running afoul of the new background killer introduced in platform 28.
* Many other bugfixes and performance tweaks.

Two big components of this code are brand new and deal with some of the worst differences between platform versions.  This will need a good deal of testing on every live Android version from 5.0 - 8.1.  Though I have tested most of this on my 7.1 daily driver, the other versions need thorough soaking.   I would suggest we test this a bit more internally before even going to Beta."
Android: Navigation to Feed via Story,"It would be a nice shortcut to be able to jump the view for a feed when browsing stories in other contexts (such as reading in mixed folders or via shares).

The interesting edge case will be stories from feeds that are not subscribed.  The app could fetch metadata for that feed and present a pre-subscription ephemeral feed view (like when visiting unsubscribed feed URLs in the web UI), but this would expand the scope of the task."
Self hosting: What causes the dashboard realtime spinner GIF to be NB-error?,"Having managed to get NB initially running as a self-hosted Docker-ised instance, I've noticed that trying to import an OPML file can be painfully slow as it trundles through site after site loading RSS feeds.

I'm not sure why this is happening. Incidentally, I've noticed that the spinner GIF is red, indicating an error:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13319608/43550372-451d3530-95db-11e8-8cfc-37c5cfa9e05f.png)

Web: Custom ordering feeds and folders (new web dialog),"Here's the support thread from which the relevant text below was pulled: https://forum.newsblur.com/t/custom-reordering-of-folders-and-feeds/4581

I used to support drag-and-drop feed re-ordering. It was awful. You would accidentally move feeds into other folders when you wanted to open them. I could have built a special move folder dialog, but custom ordering would have required it's own dialog as well. 

The dialog would have to have a segmented control (similar to the Organizer for ordering) with orders: Alphabetical, Most Used, Date Added (this is the de facto default as that's how it's stored in the DB), and Custom Order. A reset button would be nice for custom ordering as well. "
Toggle/Open sidebar pane doesn't move story pane left,"When toggling the sidebar off and on again, the story-pane-container div doesn't update its ""left"" css attribute when re-opening. After a pause of 1 or more seconds any manual resize event will fix it.

My best guess is that maybe something like a call to $story_pane.css('left',x) is changing the css value without jQuery.layout knowing about it, so it doesn't correct the value right away. Not sure why the this.resize_window right after open('west') isn't triggering it though.

Firefox is removing support for registerContentHandler,"See https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2018/navigator-registercontenthandler-has-been-removed/

I noticed that this repository contains some code that tries to register the site on which it runs as a content handler for some feed types. This will stop working once Firefox 62 is released (scheduled for the beginning of September, https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar ).

Firefox is also thinking about removing built-in feed support, so like Chrome I expect you would soon want/need an add-on if you wanted to handle RSS/Atom feeds opened in ""normal"" browser tabs by redirecting them to newsblur."

Android: Bugfixes,Handfull of bugfixes for the current Beta including at least one critical fix.  Still holding back new features until this gets out to Prod.
Backend: RFC 5005 feed history support (RSS backfill),"One long-standing flaw for using RSS/Atom to read long-form works like webcomics and fanfiction has been that feeds usually contain only a limited number of the most recent entries, so you have to catch up by reading the site directly and then switch tools to get notified about new posts. In my experience it's much nicer to be able to use a single tool to keep track of how much of the story I've already read, no matter how far back in the history I leave off. A decade ago I built [Comic Rocket](https://www.comic-rocket.com) as a proprietary tool to do that, but I'm hoping to advocate for a more standards-based approach.

It looks like NewsBlur saves old feed entries even after they disappear from the origin feed, but this doesn't reliably solve the problem, especially since creators often insert/edit/delete old pages and there's no way to detect that the cached feed entries are no longer valid.

[RFC 5005, ""Feed Paging and Archiving""](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005), addresses this problem, and I'd like to encourage people to adopt it. It was standardized in 2007, but seems to have languished in obscurity. I'm not aware of any publishers using it today aside from people I've personally encouraged, although it'd be fascinating to find out whether any feeds that newsblur.com has seen either use the `http://purl.org/syndication/history/1.0` XML namespace, or contain `<link rel=""prev-archive"">`. There's something of a catch-22 here since publishers don't have much incentive to implement the spec if feed readers don't understand it, and vice versa.

That said, I'm working on various tools to generate full-history feeds by crawling arbitrary sites, as a transitional measure. So I'm hoping to find a project like NewsBlur that's willing to be an early adopter for the reader side of the spec.

The spec is nice in that conforming feeds are still usable by feed readers that don't understand the RFC 5005 metadata, but readers that do can save the complete history of all entries and efficiently discover changes to archived entries.

If you want to implement RFC 5005, I think the easiest first step is to check each feed for the `<fh:complete/>` tag specified in [section 2, ""Complete Feeds""](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005#section-2). If present, then you can delete all entries which you previously saved from that feed if they're no longer present in the current version of the feed. This is a very simple solution for feeds that don't have much history.

For feeds that would be excessively large if the publisher put the full history in one feed document, there's [section 4, ""Archived Feeds""](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005#section-4). To implement this, you'd check for `<link rel=""prev-archive"">` in each feed, and concatenate the linked feed's entries, following further `prev-archive` links until there aren't any more. You can cache an archive feed from a given URL forever:

> The requirement that archive documents be stable allows clients to safely assume that if they have retrieved one in the past, it will not meaningfully change in the future. As a result, if an archive document's contents are changed, some clients may not become aware of the changes.

I expect some conforming publishers will change an archive feed's URL if they need to update archived entries (although this is arguably discouraged in the spec). So you'd want to ensure that you can detect that a previously-seen archive feed is no longer in the chain of `prev-archive` links, and delete any entries that don't appear in the rest of the feed. I imagine the easiest way to do that is to reconstruct the feed history from scratch on every update, but I can imagine other alternatives.

That, plus the duplicate-detection and UI recommendations in [section 4.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5005#section-4.2), I think should be everything you'd need to know about this part of the standard.

(I skipped section 3, ""Paged Feeds"", because I don't think it's relevant to a NewsBlur-style feed reader, but maybe there's a good use case for it that I haven't thought of.)

I might be able to put together a pull request for this, if it doesn't sound like wasted effort and if someone can advise me on how this might fit into the current code base. What do you think?"

"Android: Beta Fixes, Android 8 Compat, UI Affordances","* Several fixes for reported crashes and bugs in the current Beta, mostly surrounding the new story list.
* Fixes and reversions for the 27.1.0 -> 27.1.1 support library update.  TL;DR: Google introduced an unprecedented number of servere bugs in 27.1.0, which we upgraded to in the last Beta and then worked around those changes as best we could. They gave in and fixed them in 27.1.1, requiring us to selectively revert some logic to the way it used to be.  (see https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions#27-1-1)
* Partial fixes for Android 8 compatibility. Android 8 made some essentially-undocumented changes to the lifecycle of background services and the freeze/thaw cycle for Activities.  This patch includes a few fixes for the known changes, and some logging to try and help us track down the rest. (not only does testing this require several hours of wating or intentional stressing of devices, I don't as yet have an Android 8 daily driver, so we are relying on user feedback)  Basic use still looks fine except for some edge cases, and no regressions spotted for pre-8 devices.
* A suite of quick-fixes to some places where we were relying on the exclusive use of colour to conveny intel information.  I ran the app through a full colourblindness simulator and confirmed where it was impossible to view/set intel training.  Changed some colours to increase contrast in the simulated diminished colour space.  Added a tweaked version of the design guidelines' background affordances for selected toggles.  Inserted icons into intel state chips.  Confirmed that all intel state can now be viewed from the intel dialogue, and all tag state can be viewed directly.  Will need to do a touch more work to present title and author state.
* Some lead-up work and refactoring to prepare for when we can tackle the bugs around the story Pager losing state.

"Android: New Story List Pt. 2, Bugfixes","*(Note: this update includes substantial changes to dependencies; it is highly suggested to update to the latest version of gradle and to do a clean build)*

This is the completion of the story list rework.  The oldschool list view and the new grid view have been merged to both use the newest recommended framework.  As a result, all styles of story list now support all options (such as gestures) from a single, cleaner codebase.  All story lists also run at about 2x their old framerate, even with thumbnails enabled!

One big component of the new list impl involved upgrading virtually every support library dependency and dealing with 3+ years worth of breaking changes therein.  The chain of dependencies forced upgrades in basically every framework we use.  Chased down as many regressions as I could and also used some newly available features to resolve some old minor bugs.  (Notably, some of the more annoying story Pager bugs have been reduced or eliminated!)

In order to pull up said dependencies, we finally have to drop support for devices running Android 4.4 - 4.4.4, making 5.0 the new minimum, as the pre 5.0 builds are now totally unsupported by GOOG.

Also took care of a few reported crashes and bugs from the live release.

Ready for Beta.  In spite of dozens of bugfixes, this many changes might introduce some regressions, especially on non-developer devices. "

Backend: Add Facebook Pages subscriptions,"Similar to Youtube and Twitter API integration, use the Facebook OAuth credentials to allow people to subscribe to Facebook Pages.

Web: Breakout audio playback for podcasts,The music media player built into the web should have a break-away feature so it can be docked somewhere on the newsblur ui (probably at the bottom of the feed list) so it can continue playing. Also would be nice to have a break out into a new window so NewsBlur can be closed. 
duplicate folders issue,"Ive been using the nested folders features but once i get into the 4th or 5th layer of nested folders I cant view my site feeds or even move individual site feeds from folder to folder. what i mean by layers is like nesting 4 or 5 folders within each other. once i do this the problem happens. this happens in the browser version. wasnt a problem with the android app. multiple browsers. including chrome and firefox. might be due to the fact they are duplicate folders of the same thing.  it only happrens with duplicate folders after looking into the problem.

 Update: main problem was just that i had a bunch of duplicated files and couldnt view my site feeds for the duplicates."
Android: Grid View Prototype,"First pass at the grid view for the Android app is finally here.  All basic functionality should be working, though we'll need to make a pass of bugfixes and optimizations, for sure.  Also still need to add in some of the more advanced features such as gestures and column adjustments. (to come in next PR)

*First and importantly*: in order to add the dependency for the new framework that supports the grid, another set of Android framework libs had to be updated.  We had been previously been holding these back because GOOG forced some UI changes in them, so there will be some minor side effects outside of the grid view. (such as the new style pull-to-refresh indicaors on the feed list)  You may also need to double-check that your development environment is correctly picking up or importing dependency settings from the gradle config file to avoid build problems.

Performance is getting there.  This patch includes a significant rewrite of the way we load thumbnail images for stories.  The old loader would pretty always eventually OOM any non-flagship device, because some feeds specify thumbnails that can be many megapixels per story.  I added a system to do lossless streaming downsampling of thumbnails and it has helped quite a bit.  We'll probably need to go even a bit further, though, as the grid view still eats a good deal of RAM and CPU.

I tried to match the grid tile UI to the web UI, while still making good use of very limited screen space and respecting the Android UX guidelines.  Let me know if anything is far off the mark.

This should be released as an alpha, at most.  We'll need to do a fair amount of testing for regressions in both story list views, as many points were touched. (that said, some of this work also drastically speeds up the old list view when thumbs are enabled!)"

* tweaked rendering of pre blocks to mitigate UX of wide block on small screens (#1076)

* totally refactored the story list fragment in anticipation of supporting a grid-style story list (#1052). decoupled the view layer from loading and startup logic.  the grid view will need to use a totally different view framework (RecyclerView) that is not backwards-compatible with the old ListView and Adapter paradigms.  we are now free to have many different story displays without having to rewrite loading and launch logic.

Due to the massive refactor required to support GOOG's new framework, this should soak in Beta for a week or two, as the change surface is massive and we should eliminate regressions in our loading logic before enabling the new framework code, which is reported to be somewhat buggy, though necessary."

NewsBlur performed poorly, getting an F on a standard(?) American school evaluation scale.

While I'm not expert on making sites secure by tweaking HTTP response headers and this might be just hot air, it looks a bit bad to be on the lower end of the scale, especially when it comes to internet security. There might be some easy pickings you might want to change or fix in order to get a bit better result.

Web: Make Goodies more visible,"It would be great if goodies for current platform were more exposed, or at least documented in some googleable place.

Today I was looking for a way to integrate Newsblur with Firefox RSS subscription feature, and the way I've found it was:

1. Googling ""firefox rss subscribe newsblur""
2. Finding the FF docs for registering RSS readers
3. Searching for ""registerContentHandler"" in the debuger
4. Finding there's a thing called ""goodies"" with integrations, apps, etc.

Improve delete folder backup email,"When a user deletes a folder, it receives an email message with a backup of all its sites. It is amazing!
However, if it is the first time you are deleting a folder, the message can scare you.
It just happened to me, that's why Im opening this issue.

The thing is, the following message:
https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/blob/90498f5b9511072c62a2b37cd2172a058c614ed2/apps/reader/views.py#L1964
`You have deleted an entire folder of feeds, so here's a backup just in case.`

It will get concatenated with another string - the total number of your feeds.
https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/blob/55c36a24f38c25561e64b4365767547e3945ac1b/templates/mail/email_opml_export.txt

So, the final message will be something like:
`You have deleted an entire folder of feeds, so here's a backup just in case. It contains 66 sites.`

If you deleted an empty folder, this email message may make you feel like NewsBlur had a bug and deleted everything you owned.
My heart stopped for a second...

My suggestion is to change the first string to something like
`You have deleted an entire folder of feeds, so here's a backup OF ALL YOUR FEEDS just in case.`

The ALL YOUR FEEDS part do not need to go in caps."
iOS: Images fail to load,"On a regular basis, stories whose contents are exclusively or mostly images don't load their images.  This happens most commonly with Web comics but also with sites like Flickr.  This never happens on the Web.  This issue has been happening for months to perhaps even years.  It is not consistent within a single feed — sometimes an image will load, sometimes it won't.  The same thing affects the images in the article list.  I have had trouble reproducing this with a debugger attached, but figured I might as well post a few examples here from today:

Android: Action/Sync Queue Can Become Blocked,"Over the last several months we have had very small but very steady number of bug reports from users about the app refusing to sync.  Debug info received from them shows a comon cause of the action queue becoming poisoned by blocking requests.

More recently, the sync logic was changed so that a *failed* action in the queue would not block the queue or the sync loop, on the suspicion that it was merely fatally bad actions poisoning the queue.  This improvement has not eradicated the issue, suggesting that the blocking actions are actually blocking in a network/execution sense and not just failing and being retried.

The commonly effective workaround of clearing app data suggest that there may exist a class of actions that are fatally impossible to incomplete.

Ideally, it would be great if we could devise a mechanism for getting raw debug/log info from users that experience this bug, so we can fix the root cause(s), since, whatever they are, they have totally evaded reproduction.  In the meantime, it may be necessary to break the in-order call contract and risk slight data loss about reading actions if the problem gets any more common."

Android: Feed Search Field State Not Frozen,"When searching for a new feed to add, any state entered into the search field is lost on context freeze/thaw.  This behaviour is entirely controlled by our use of the system search service component.

In order to fix this, we would need to do one of two things: 
* Work out the internals of the `intent.action.SEARCH` / `SearchManager` activity template and attempt to manually freeze/thaw the correct state
* Replace our half-/hybrid- implementation of a system style search with a more simple activity that is 100% under our control

I suspect the latter is the correct solution, because it will also allow us to fix related bugs in this activity w.r.t. result loading."

Performance improvement suggestion,"Dear developers,
I found several bitmap displaying issues in NewsBlur. These issues could affect performance. 

(1) In the position:
com.newsblur.util.PrefsUtils.java  getUserImage()
the bitmap object is created with the invocation of decodeFile().
I found getUserImage() is invoked directly and indirectly by:
com.newsblur.fragment.ProfileDetailsFragment.java   onCreateView()
com.newsblur.activity.Main.java                     onCreate()
com.newsblur.fragment.LoginProgressFragment$LoginTask.java    onPostExecute()
which means image decoding operation is performed in the UI thread.
Android documentation says this:
https://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/process-bitmap.html
"" The BitmapFactory.decode* methods should not be executed on the main UI thread if the source data is read from disk or a network location""
Image decoding is slow. So, do you think the slow operation will affect NewsBlur's performance (e.g., make GUI not smooth enough). If yes, for performance considerations, we should perform the image decoding operations in worker threads (e.g., via AsyncTask).

In addition, Android documentation says this:
https://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/load-bitmap.html#load-bitmap
"" Images come in all shapes and sizes. In many cases they are larger than required for a typical application user interface (UI)""
"" To avoid java.lang.OutOfMemory exceptions, check the dimensions of a bitmap before decoding it, unless you absolutely trust the source to provide you with predictably sized image data that comfortably fits within the available memory ""
Do you think we should check the dimensions of a bitmap before decoding it? If the bitmap is larger than required, we can resize it before decoding, so as to reduce memory and time overhead.

(2) In the position:
com.newsblur.util.ImageLoader.java  decodeBitmap()
the bitmap object is created with the invocation of decodeFile().
I found decodeBitmap() is invoked indirectly by: 
com.newsblur.view.ActivityDetailsAdapter.java    getView()
which means that there will be many bitmap objects being created. 
Do you think we should also check the dimensions of a bitmap before decoding it in this position?

In addition, we can use Option.inbitmap to reuse the memory space of existing bitmap objects, which will reduce memory consumption and improves app's performance.

Looking forward to your response and hope I can help improve NewsBlur.
Thanks.

"Android: Confirmations, Better Sync, Beta Notifications","Implemented an option to require confirmation when marking-read ranges of stories (#965).

Made some improvements to how the sync service behaves when it is having trouble contacting the NewsBlur servers.  It will no longer give up fetching metadata or stories because it is having occasional failures posting other calls.  Added some advanced logic to ensure that actions still attempt to follow the contract around order of operations, but repeated failures don't totally break the UX.  (this has been a complaint of customers for at least a year, now, but there have been a few new mentions of it in the last three releases)  I successfully tested the app with the network cranked all the way up to 75% packet loss and the UI now continues fetching new stories, if slowly.

Implemented a very basic beta of new story notifications (#966).  As requested, they only happen when a feed with Android-specific notifications are turned on gets a new focus story.  this is *only* a beta of the notification posting process.  The actual notification UI will have to be designed and implemented once we are satisfied with their general behaviour."

Android: bugfixes,"Fixes and improvements for the 5.0.0 beta, ready to become b2."
Android: Story notifications,"This is a big ticket feature. There are two parts to this feature, this ticket only focuses on the actual notification. Choosing notifications for feeds is the next ticket, but we can launch that later.

0) Go on the web and right-click feeds to setup ""Notifications"" for android. You should be able to see it as it's available to admins.

1) After `/reader/feeds?flat=true` is loaded, loop through every feed and check if 'android' is in any feed.notification_types. If so, request notification privileges on the device.

2) Once android gives you a notification token that can be used for pushing remote notifications, send that token to POST to `/notifications/android_token/` with `android_token` as the key. This is idempotent, so you can submit this over and over again with the same token. That's what we do on iOS, to handle changing tokens. This endpoint is also device-aware, so multiple devices can submit different tokens to the same endpoint and each device will receive notifications.

Use `http://www.newsblur.com/notifications/force_push?feed_id=X&count=N` to test notifications. Feel free to hit it as much as you like.

Ideally I'd like to get images in the notification preview, as I did on iOS.

Threaded sort,"Right now you can only sort feeds by date. But once https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/961 is implemented, it will be useful to sort them by their subject line first, date second, the way many threading email clients do it.

An even more advanced feature would collapse all threads to look like one story, collapse read messages in each thread, and collapse quoted text in each message. Then you're basically Gmail.
"
"Sort ""newsletters"" by list-id","Sorting simple newsletters by their ""From"" header makes sense, but mailing lists with multiple senders should be sorted by their list-id header. For example, if I subscribe newsblur to the [linux kernel mailing list](http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-kernel), the incoming mails will look like this:

From: Linus Torvalds torvalds@linux-foundation.org
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As it stands now, I would see a new folder called ""Linus Torvalds"", and thousands more folders for everybody else who sends to the list. But if you sorted by the list-id header when it exists, I would only see one folder for the whole list. This would be much more useful!

iOS: Returning to app on iPad reloads story,"From https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/different-behaviour-ipad-vs-iphone-switching-windows:

I've noticed that when switching windows/apps on iPhone away from NewsBlur, for example if I open a link from a post in Safari, and then switch back to NewsBlur, it does not re-load the post, i.e. I'm back to exactly to where I had scrolled, or embedded video remains paused at the same spot. This is great. 

However on iPad, switching back to the NewsBlur app causes the post to refresh, losing my place or resetting the embedded video, which is annoying. 

Is there a way to get the app to work on iPad like it does on iPhone?

Regression: `If-None-Match:`/`If-Modified-Since` headers for caching isn’t sent by feed fetcher,"1. Subscribe to https://www.newsblur.com/site/6462590/feed-request-headers-echoed

4. Look at the newest feed entry’s content message for a `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers.

No `If-None-Match` header is sent (and thus not echoed by this test feed). Breaks Newsblur’s RFC 3229+feed implementation. This is not fixed by pull request #958, but that pull request hides the `A-IM: feed` header when there is no `If-None-Match` header to go with it.

No `If-Modified-Since` header is sent, forcing servers to return the entire feed instead of a simple 304 Not Modified response.

I found [some evidence](https://blog.flameeyes.eu/2013/03/why-you-should-care-about-your-http-implementation/) that this used to work in the past.

Option is disabled by default, since using it could lead to some very high and unexpected data usage for mobile users.

Also took the time to really clean up our image caching framework (offline reading, thumbnails, and icons) now that we are doing so much with it.  Gone should be the days of leaked storage and wild memory use numbers.

Many icons redone from vector/PSD in significantly higher resolution.  Some old raster elements converted to vector.  UI cleanup is now complete, except for the login screen, which will best be addressed when we do #921.

Android: UI Improvements,"This change goes after a good number of small UI tweaks for which we've had open issues.  In particular:
- added fleurons to completed story lists (#903)
- fixed list background colours (per comments in #903)
- adjustable font sizes for story lists (#861)
- forgot-password workflow (#900)
- minor fixes to focus pathing (#837)

I also did a pass over some mismatched or slightly-off theme colours and made them more closely match the iOS UI or the web UI or both (where possible), vaguely guided by the Android UX guidelines (again, where possible).  I would say that about 75% of the app now has a nice, clean, consistent palate; I'll be finishing off the remaining artifacts in the next pull.

Finally, a handfull of bux fixes.  Also bit the bullet and cut off update support for the oldest ~4% of Android devices out there that were costing us a ton of time in testing and support.

"Rotating iPhone while viewing story in ""in-app Safari"" exits Safari","If you're reading a story in the in-app Safari view, then rotate the iPhone, it jumps back to the Story view instead of staying in the now-rotated Safari view.
- Launch NewsBlur on an iPhone (6s Plus here)
- In Settings, choose ""in-app Safari"" as your browser
- Look at a story
- Tap the Safari icon to show the story in in-app Safari
- Rotate the iPhone into Landscape orientation
- Safari view rotates, then slides off screen and you're returned to the story view.

This is mostly annoying if you were part way down the web page and rotated the iPhone (accidentally or on purpose), and now you have to both open the Safari view again and scroll back to where you were.

Unrelatedly, it might be useful to have a ""go back to the safari view"" button from the main page.  I've noticed that if I have, say, an embedded video (or an annoying auto-play ad) or something playing in the Safari view that if I leave it and go back to the Story view, that video it keeps playing with no obvious way to stop it (i.e.: you can hear the audio, and presumably it's using CPU time and bandwidth).  It seems like the Safari view should be killed/paused/whatever when it is closed.  I can open a separate issue for this if you like.

Thanks!

Homepage: Lastpass compatability,"Hello there,

Firstly, thank you for Newsblur!

I have a feature request for the homepage: Lastpass compatibility.

Currently, while the username and password fields are recognized as such by Lastpass, clicking the autofill menus in the text fields does not populate them. I'm afraid I can't figure out exactly why this is the case. Newsblur is the only site where I've seen this behavior.

It's still possible to log in by typing/copying a username from the Lastpass browser extension, it's just slightly more mousework.

"iPad: Locking iPad can lose story view, aborting AirPlay of videos","I subscribe to a number of YouTube channels through NewsBlur.  I'll commonly Save stories containing videos to watch later on my iPad, streaming them to my AppleTV.

The problem is that the iPad will automatically lock after 5 minutes.  That's fine, since it's still playing on the TV through AirPlay.  The problem is that if the story is far enough down the Saved list (>20 stories down; I'm not sure of the exact value), when the iPad locks the story view is destroyed.  This of course cancels AirPlay, which means I now have to unlock my iPad, tap on a different story (because that story is already selected, even though the story view is empty), then tap back on the story I wanted, hit Play, and seek forward to where I think I was last time.

It gets pretty annoying.  It's actually been happening for a long time now, but I only recently figured out what was going on.

You can reproduce the disappearing story view without using AirPlay, and without playing a video:
- Launch NewsBlur
- Save 40+ stories
- Go to your saved stories
- Select the first story (it seems you have to do this first)
- Scroll down and select a story
- Hit the home button or lock the iPad
- Unlock the iPad, or just go back into NewsBlur
- Notice that the Story View is now empty.  If you were playing a video when the iPad was locked, it would stop playing.

Unfortunately, this isn't as deterministic as I'd like.  I had to do it a few times, selecting a story, locking, unlocking, selecting another story, locking, unlocking, etc. until it gave me the issue.  Of course it feels like it does it every time when I'm trying to watch a video over AirPlay.

Screenshot attached, but it's not very impressive, since it looks exactly the same as it does when you first go into the Saved list with no story selected.

Thanks!

iOS: Clean up activity handling,"I couldn't figure out why a UIActivityItemProvider subclass also implements UIActivityItemSource (working around an old bug?) so I picked one.  I re-added the URL as a separate activity item; it works well in everything I've tested. Particularly when sharing to Twitter, Facebook, Reminders and Notes it looks better include the URL separately.  It also eliminates an extra newline that was showing up when sharing to OmniFocus.

Another motivation was fixing sharing to Reading List (see https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/send_to_reading_list_not_working_in_ios_apps).

Android: Improve Icon Cache Cleanup,"The newest Android / Google Play Store framework has a feature that suggests to users that apps should be uninstalled if their use of device storage is too high.  This is probably a good time to get our ducks in a row w.r.t. how we cache icons.

Though they are very small and the dataset changes very slowly, we essentially never clean up the favicon/profilepic caches.  We should refit those caches with the nice, new cleanup framework that we implemented for the offline image cache last year.

Android: Extremely Slow DB Resets for Hyperusers,"If a user with thousands of feeds and thousands of fetched stories upgrades the app or logs out manually, the DB is wiped as per usual, but on many devices, the SQLite engine takes many seconds or even a few minutes to perform the DROP TABLE operations.  Though no errors occur, it does cause unsightly and very confusing UI freezes.  This is especially bad when a hyperuser upgrades the app.

We should research if there is a faster way to clear the DB than dropping tables (maybe just switch to a totally new DB file and then later sweep up the old files?).  If nothing else, we should add a progress indication so that users do not think the app has frozen or crashed.
"
Android: Fix On-Upgrade Crashes,"Finally gave in and implemented some more strict on-upgrade checking.  Newer devices were launching the UI so quickly, sometimes the app would crash because the UI was trying to access the DB before it was upgraded.

There is now a splash screen when the app is opened the first time after install or upgrade while the check is occuring.  Total time from app start to the UI being displayed in full has actually stayed the same or gone down (time in the spash is == the time the UI used to pause with the ""Tidying up"" message), though being forced to use a spash might make it appear a bit slower due to some unfortunate cognitive biases.  Can't think of any more reliable way to finally squash the on-upgrade crashes, though.

Also disabled debug logging, since I expect this will be our final release candidate if all goes smoothly.

hacker news feeds not updating correctly,"This might very well be user error on my part, but trying to pull from rss feeds for hacker news based on number of points seem to not be working. When using the feed from hnrss (filter for posts with greater than 75 points), I don't get any new posts at all (most recent that shows up is from yesterday). It seems like it might be some kind of caching issue on the newsblur server end maybe (just a guess on my part) because the hnrss feed I had on my newsblur account was pulling updates correctly but the search was not working. I tried deleting and re-adding the feed to fix the search (which does now work) but now it does not pull the latest updates from hacker news. Going to the hnrss.org website and manually looking at their rss feed for a filter with 75 points does show properly updating stories.

Android: Housekeeping and new Intel State Toggle,"The primary functional change here is the implementation of #908: a big visual update to the long-neglected state toggle widget.  Not only did it previously fail to match either the NewsBlur web or iOS UIs, it also failed to fit on smaller device screens since the addition of the 4th (saved) state and grossly violated pretty much every Android UX guideline.  I took a somewhat creative approach to satisfying all of these requirements at the same time.  The general look and feel matches the newest iOS style, but translated into the design language of the Android platform.  I solved the space/clipping problem by making the buttons collapse when not selected. (this is best explained by playing with the toggle)  All four buttons now nicely fit on even the smallest device we support.

The secondary set of changes here is a ton of housekeeping that I wanted to get done before any more functional changes.  This included getting rid of dozens of lint errors, compile warnings, and deprecated API touchpoints.  Also fixed some various warnings that AS and gradle liked to throw during the new and improved build processes.  Finally, removed some API usages that were problematic on the most recent Android ""N"" version and causing trouble there.  I think this is the first time in over two years that it is possible to do a zero-warnings release build!

Web: Dark theme,"Searching getsatisfaction for ""Dark theme"", 55 results are shows. This really displays the demand for a NewsBlur experience, which is more forgiving to the eyes.

4 years ago, DivinoAG created [this thread](https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/dark_theme-10kwnp) asking for an official dark theme, and sharing his own custom one with the community. 

Sadly, the theme has not been updated in over 2 years, and since then, changes have been made to the site, which breaks certain elements, that suddenly display in glaring white. And many small menus and pop-up boxes are not themed at all.

I think it's time for an official NewsBlur dark theme, which is why I am creating this ticket. I hope the suggestion is accepted.

Here are a few notes on how I think it should be implemented:
- In the gerneral tab of the preferences menu, there should be a topic called ""Theme"", where the user can choose between the default white theme and a dark theme
- The dark theme should be based on the color scheme of DivinoAG's custom CSS. 
- Every aspect of the NewsBlur experience should be themed, from the obvious feed panes, to little pop-up boxes and menus.

Edit: I have updated his style, but only so it just covers the most seen elements. And it only works on split view and list view. It can be found [here](https://userstyles.org/styles/124890/newsblur-dark-theme-by-splike), and is a good starting ground for the official dark theme.

I think I am finally ready to call the hyperuser scaling issues done.  Good spot for a Beta once this passes the usual smoke tests by us.

"Android: Hyperuser Fixes, Part 2","Tweaking the new and improved story fetch lifecycle to have all of the behaviours we expect, like:
- only fetch a set of pages of stories for a given feed/folder once per high-level feed sync
- have reasonable timeouts
- story lists shouldn't be jumpy
- dont' show debug status lines when debug isn't enabled
- don't crash

I also upgraded our HTTP libs, since not only have there been some nice speed increases in them, there are also a few security vulns to patch (none directly affect us, but GOOG might start flagging APKs that use out-of-date ones).  Updating to the most modern version also opens the door for us to start doing interruptable IO in a slightly less messy way, should we deem it necessary.

Android: Hyperuser Improvements,"A big pass at improving the performance of the app for users who have huge numbers of unreads and a high throughput of new stories (what I have been calling 'hyperusers' as shorthand).  In addition to some basic tuning and tweaking of the DB, I also did some major overhauls to the way we store and query stories to remove any O(n) (where n is number of unreads or new stories for an account) DB operations and overall shorten DB lock times by a factor of 2-5 across the board.  Average users with total unread counts below 10k shouldn't notice much difference, but the change for big users should be like night and day.

That said, the touch surface here was enormous.  I want to get this into y'all's hands so we can have at least 3 sets of eyes using it and looking for regressions and so that there aren't any nasty surprise merges lurking for anyone else touching the code.  I wouldn't be surprised if we'll need to do a few more tweaks and fixes before this is Beta-ready.

iOS: Swiping between stories sometimes gets stuck,"I typically use the NewsBlur iOS app by refreshing my feeds, clicking on ""All stories"" with the filter of oldest first and unread only selected, and then start swiping side to side to navigate between the stories. Recently I've run into an issue where occasionally I swipe the story to the left to go to the next story and the story gets ""stuck"". I can see the next story when it feels like I'm trying to pull the new story onto the screen, but I can't get it to come. Hitting the next story button seems to resolve the issue, but it is still a little annoying.

More specific repro steps (some of it may be irrelevant to the bug, but I'm including it for the sake of completeness):
1. Refresh feeds
2. Click on all stories
3. Ensure story filter set to unread only, oldest first
4. Begin swiping from the right side of the screen to the left to advance to the next story
5. After some number of successful swipes (maybe 10 or so?), one story will seem to get ""stuck"" where I'm unable to swipe it to the side. 

At this point, I can either press the next button to advance or back out to the list of stories, click on the latest story, and begin advancing by swiping side to side again.  

The story pulls to the side as though it is going to advance properly, but it feels like it has more gravity than other stories so refuses to advance (much like when you're scrolling to the top of a list on iOS and it is clear that pulling more won't actually make it go further).

I'm running the iPhone 6S Plus (64GB) on T-Mobile on iOS 9.2, although I also noticed this issue on 9.1. The app store tells me I'm running NewsBlur app version 5.0.2. If there's a debug build I can run that would let you get logs to help debug this, I'd be happy to do so. Also please let me know if you need any more information, I'd be happy to provide it! Love the app and service, long-time premium member (since Google Reader so rudely kicked me off!)

It seems that many RSS feeds strip out the required script tags for some reason, breaking the original content.

For stories especially, it'd be good to support four background colors, like the Safari view controller: white, sepia, gray & black.

- Click the Home button to leave the app
- Go back to NewsBlur (you have to wait a couple seconds, it seems; if you go back too fast the error won't show, presumably because NewsBlur hasn't shut down yet?).  Everything looks fine.

iOS: rotating iPad when viewing the new Safari view controller breaks NewsBlur layout on return,"In portrait mode on the iPad (Air 2, iOS 9.1) I'm looking at a story in NewsBlur, and I want to see the rest in the embedded Safari view controller. I tap the compass and Safari appears, but the content is easier to view in landscape mode. I rotate the iPad, and when I'm finished I hit Done to return leave Safari. Unfortunately, it seems NewsBlur didn't get the rotate message and is now displaying the story views incorrectly. 

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3717537/10868849/a137399a-8069-11e5-85b5-e681783dd809.png)

The above image shows the problem after closing Safari.  Steps:
- Make sure NewsBlur is set to use the new Safari view controller
- Hold the iPad in Portrait mode
- Go to Global Shared and view a story
- Tap the compass to open the Safari view
- Rotate the iPad to landscape mode
- Tap the done button to return to NewsBlur. Notice the layout seems to be shrunk as though it is still in portrait mode, even though we're in landscape mode. 

Thanks again

Android: Beta 2 for Lollipop Compat,"Another big round of fixes to get us running smoothly on the newest version of Android.  Fixes several crashes and some nonsensical behaviour resulting from the OS's naïve attempts to automagically back up all the wrong things.

The first time I share a story it works fine. The second time, though, brings up the keyboard but does not open pane containing the multiline edit field and the button to commit the share. Killing the app and relaunching it fixes the problem. This was seen when testing on an iPad. 
- Launch NewsBlur. 
- Share any story (tap the Share button, the tap the Share button in the new pane that opens). 
- Go to on any other story. 
- Tap Share for this story. The keyboard will appear, but the edit field and related buttons do not.

The screenshot shows the keyboard is visible, but the pane to type comments and the button to commit the submission is not.

- Open NewsBlur on an iPad in portrait or landscape mode. 
- Go to Global Shared Stories. 
- Choose any story after the first one.
- Click the home button to leave the app
- Go back int NewsBlur. The current story and previous stories are now both partially visible.

More importantly, the included design changes will make it much easier in the future to keep reducing CPU and memory overhead.

Also cleaned up a good deal of legacy code and resources and fixed some lint.

Finally, squashed a few spare issues that were identified in the last few weeks.

I anticipate a few more tweaks before we can finally push all this new stuff all the way to Prod, but I think this is a great checkpoint to send to Beta.

Android: Fatal API Failures May Block Updates,"We've had several reports over the last few days of Android users being unable to get new stories on their devices.  After working with some affected users, it appears that some API action(s) are getting stuck in the action queue, blocking further API activity.

As a general rule, pending API actions (mark read, save, share, etc) are executed ASAP before other API actions or reads.  If these fail for any unexpected reason, they are kept in the queue to prevent data loss.  To ensure correct order-of-operations, they are executed strictly in the order corresponding to the user actions that caused them.  Should any API action fail repeatedly or in a fatal manner, that action can block the API queue and cause the app to stop functioning properly.

I haven't been able to reproduce any of these fatal API calls, so it is difficult to diagnose what is causing them.  If anyone can identify one or more, we can put together a fix.  There appears to have been a spike in these over the last few days, if that leads to any hints.

As a work-around, the action queue can be cleared by logging out/in of the app.

Android: Activities and Interactions,"So I've tried to keep this as close the the behaviour as seen on the web as a could. As mentioned previously comment navigation isn't supported. But once @dosiecki has merged his other changes I'll look at adding scrolling to the comment header in a further PR.

The only other difference from the web is that it only supports navigating to feeds/users that the app knows about. It doesn't go searching for any user/story like the web does if you don't follow a user/subscribe to a feed etc.

I'm open to any suggestions/feedback you might have.

Feature request: Adding notes to saved stories.,"Hi, 

I'm not sure how feasible or how much work this would be, but would it be possible to add the ability to add notes to saved stories? Sometimes I save stories that have a specific thing(s) that I would like to remember about it when I come back to it later. Right now I kind of hack this feature using the tags, but it can get unwieldy if the note is long. If the notes could also be searchable that would be amazing. 

Again, not sure how feasible or how much work this would be, but it would be really handy for some use cases I think. 

Thanks.

Android: Latest System WebView Changes Reading UX,"On devices running Android version 5.0 or greater, the system WebView component is now updated more regularly, out-of-sync with overall OS updates.  The latest update pushed out to users (43.0.2357.121) greatly changed the behaviour of HTML links within an app.

The old, desired behaviour of opening links in the user's chosen browser has been replaced by opening the link within the same WebView View within the app.  This has caused countless bugs:
- Pages not conditioned (with our custom CSS) to be viewed in-app tend not to render entirely on-screen
- Scrolling of content can be badly broken
- Back-button functionality is broken - if a link is clicked, hitting back exits the Reading activity rather than going back to the page that contained the link
- In-app browser state is not shared with the user's browser, so logins don't work, nor does history get populated
- Much JavaScript tends to be broken in a constrained app View

I've had several reports from people saying this makes the app ""unusable"", so pursuing a fix for this ASAP.

- Inconsistent use of ""share"" vs. platform ""send to""
- New comments did not always appear until leaving reading view and performing full refresh
- New comment replies did not always appear until leaving reading view and performing full refresh
- Friend comments did not appear if public comments were present and enabled
- Shares could not be performed offline
- Replies could not be performed offline
- Creation and removal of favourites could not be performed offline
- Comments and replies on stories read via Global Shared Stories leaked into storage
- All comment, reply, and favourite actions had long UI lag
- All comment, reply, and favourite actions had massive memory churn
- Replies other than first reply on a comment never showed
- Un-shared stories never disappeared from a user's share list

Additional improvements and bugfixes:

- Improved instrumentation of network latency
- Removal of orphaned resources
- Crash fixes
- Fixed bleeding of sync metadata after account switch (would keep downloading stories/images for old account)

Android: Adjustable Ordering for Saved Stories,"I love NewsBlur, and I find that the majority of time, I use it on my Android smartphone.  That being the case, would it be possible to have options for different story orders for the current feeds section & the saved stories section?  Specifically, I enjoy showing ""oldest first"" stories within my current feeds (so I can read things in the order they happened).  However for saved stories, I would prefer those to be sorted by ""newest first,"" as the older it is, the less likely I am interested in the saved story.  I thought at one point the Android app used to behave like this natively, but I could be wrong about that.  Currently, I have to change the story order every time I go into ""saved stories"" on my Android device, and then I have to switch that back when I access my current feeds.  Thanks in advance for your consideration of this feature request!
"
Android: Upgrade HTTP Lib,"The default HTTP client lib on older Android devices is pretty badly broken and has no upgrade path.  In the lastest release of Android, GOOG have stated that they have no intent of maintaining it.

We should probably switch to github.com/square/okhttp or one of the other popular client libs so we have better control over how we call the server.

Android: Use existing login session_id,"For some reason Android calls /reader/login every single time it loads. This is the wrong behavior. You should cache the newsblur_sessionid cookie on login and then reuse that overtime until it is invalid (and you get an 'authenticated: false' message in the response.

The reason for this necessary change is that all of those sessions are being stories in the database and it's causing the redis session database to become hugely bloated.

On iOS I don't have to do anything special, since the cookie is automatically stored and used on every newsblur.com request. This will also cut down some time when loading feeds, as the login call does not need to happen again. 

The cookie should be good for 1 year.

I also noticed that when I opened my profile it still said I was following 1 but that updated to 0 while I was viewing the profile so presumably opening the profile triggered that to update.

Should the unfollow be picked up from the subsequent FolderFeedsResponse? Perhaps there is some state that isn't being cleared in the database? I haven't had a chance to look at the code yet.

Android: Fetching Recent Stories Fails,"On Android, the list of feeds isn't updating, either automatically or when attempting to do so manually. It seems to get stuck Fetching Recent Stories.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Newsblur
2. Let it refresh/pull down to make sure everything is fully synced.
3. Select either Unread or Focus at the bottom (haven't tried All).
4. Select either All Stories or any folder (individual feeds seem to be ok).
5. Without selecting a story, scroll to the bottom of the list.

Expected behavior: Newsblur polls the server for additional stories. i.e. I currently have 300 unread Focus stories, but the list only shows 20 or so. When I scroll to the bottom of these 20, Newsblur should continue to load additional stories.

Actual behavior. Instead of loading additional stories, Newsblur says Fetching Recent Stories but never does so. See image:

Preference Stories > Open Links > In New Tab is selected.
Using 'Feed' view and 'Full' mode (not 'List').

Focusing a story via 'j'/'k' and then pressing 'o' opens the story in a foreground tab.
The expected behavior is for it to open in a background tab.

I'm assuming Chrome just updated because it was definitely working last weekend and other than possibly Newsblur that's the only thing that could be different.

I'm not seeing any errors or warnings in the Console, so I'm guessing Google changed the handling of `MouseEvents`. In looking at the `open_story_in_new_tab` function within _NewsBlur/media/js/newsblur/models/stories.js_ I notice it uses `init_mouse_events` which [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent.initMouseEvent) says is deprecated. I'm not well versed in JS and my attempt at changing that (and the previous line) to `b = new MouseEvent(""click"", {bubbles: true, cancelable: true, view: window, ctrl:true, meta:true});` in Chrome's dev tools only made it open the link in the current tab instead.

This was also noted by another user on [GetSatisfaction](https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/open_articles_in_a_new_tab?topic-reply-list%5Bsettings%5D%5Bfilter_by%5D=all&topic-reply-list%5Bsettings%5D%5Breply_id%5D=15040085#reply_15040085).

So nobody else has needed this other than me, but now that we have a user-specific Android bug I'm going to need to allow either of you (Daniel or Mark) to login as another user. This is a rather sensitive permission, as you will have access to a user's data. But it also gives you the ability to diagnose real issues. 

There's an endpoint at `/reader/login_as?user=[user]` that you can use to login as another user. On iOS I added a hidden menu option that only appears if you are logged in as staff. You can find out of the user is staff by checking the `is_staff` value returned from `/reader/feeds`. Then show a ""Login as..."" menu item that opens a dialog that asks for a username. Send that over to the above endpoint and you'll be logged in as the user. 

I will receive an email every time this happens, but you have permission to use this to figure out user issues.

This is hopefully a quick feature, as nobody will ever see it, but it makes debugging so much easier. I have this on iOS and have diagnosed many ios specific issues this way.

Android: Stabilise Pager Offsets,"Now that story sets can be updated (rather than cleared and replaced) it is quite possible for the meaning of ""story N, given the selected sort order and filters"" to change when newer stories arrive in the app.  Thus, when reading from story N to N+1 or N-1, users can repeat stories or miss stories.

The fundamental problem is with pagers navigating via cursor index, not some custom, sortable identifier.

There is a mitigation in place to never modify the story list with new stories while in the item list or reading views, but if the user taps out of the app to open a story or follow a link, the list may update when they go back to our app.  Thus, the existing mitigation is insufficient.

Mark newer/older as read extremely likely to destroy everything with now way to rescue,"A was forced to upgrade to the beta version 4.0 of the NewsBlur Android app as my Nexus phone has just been updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop. I like the offline sync function but I am **very scared** by the presence of both mark newer and older as read options in the tap list. I am reading my stories oldest-first from all threads at once (‘All stories’ list). I am scrolling down regularly marking all the seen (i.e. older) stories as read.

However, in the current beta-version of the app there are **both options to mark older and newer stories as read side by side**. I am quite sure I will **by accident tap on the wrong option** (i.e. mark newer as read instead of the correct older as read option) and I will effectively **completely and irreversibly destroy** my 400 long list of unread stories with **no confirmation or anything**.

Such a **extremely dangerous function** should definitely be protected at least by a confirmation dialogue (at least when marking more then 5 stories or so at once) or **should be removed at all** (at least as a configuration option in the application settings).

I really do not know why to add option to destroy all following stories in the list the user does not have any chance to see. **Function ‘Mark previous as read’ in the 3.6 version of the app was _definitely_ the correct and totally satisfactory implementation of this function.** Please, add that back, do not let users to destroy their valuable long time build lists of stories to read with no chance to rescue.

Finally had to pay off some technical debt and do some housecleaning we have been putting off for a year or two.  The original codebase used some ""features"" of the DB that have been fixed in the newest version of android. (read: they were bugs)  Much of the DB code has been gutted and simplified.  Also finally went after the old (mis)use of loaders and modernized our use of cursors.  Lastly, had to re-work some activity and fragment lifecycle stuff to allow for the fact that versions 4.x and 5.0 do things in slightly different orders.

All around, should be a speed-up on any device, though, and the codebase is ever shrinking.

Android: Replace confirmation dialog with undobar when marking folder as read,"Inspired by https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/any-plans-for-undo-action-button-for-incorrectly-mark-all-as-read-on-a-feed-or-folder I thought it might be nice to replace the dialog with an undobar (like GMail/Pocket see https://plus.google.com/+RomanNurik/posts/RA9WEEGWYp6).

It wouldn't interrupt the flow of using the app as much and seems to be an Android UI pattern that is becoming more popular.

Any thoughts?

iOS: Blurry text on iPhone 6,"There is blurry text in Newsblur app on the iPhone 6.  It looks like it was somehow magnified onto the larger screen, so you can see the text is not crisp like it is in the other apps.  I haven't tried it on the 6 Plus, but would expect the problem to be worse there.

You can see the blurriness on the partial screenshot below:

"
Android: Sync issues b/w read and unread stories when reading stories on web,"See https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/android-app-beta-2. Pretty good description:

So the post-all stories refresh problem is fixed. The sync issue between the app and the desktop is still broken though. Just a refresher for the problem: 

1) open app, sync stories (no download stories options enabled in settings, unread only viewing mode) 
2) read stories on desktop 
3) refresh app, observe correct adjustment of unread counts 
4) open feed that was read on desktop, observe read stories still in bold as if unread 

bonus: 
5) hit mark feed as read...the app says marked as read, and goes back to the main screen and refreshes 
6) go back to the same feed, stories still there in bold as if unread 

they only clear from the app if they are manually read by the app 

one other tiny issue is with marking as unread...it works fine as one would expect, but the little dialog that says story marked as unread doesnt pop up
"
Android: Cached cells show incorrect author when no author on story,"See https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/wrong-authors-shown-next-to-some-articles-in-all-stories-view.

Looks like the author is getting cached when you scroll the story titles view. A story that has no author will show the old cell's author. I suggest using an empty string for missing authors so it's not actually missing.

Android: Fix crash on upgrade.,"Quick fix to make sure upgrades don't crash.  (Long-term we might be able to find a more reliable way of doing this using DB versioning)
"
Android: Offline Beta 2,"This patch implements delayed/offline replay of mark-read type actions and fixes many bugs found in the first beta, including #537, #564, #566, and more.  It also reduces memory and battery use.

This is by no means 100% bug-free, but I think it is a good candidate for B2, as it fixes some of the more noisome bugs and actually lets you read offline without losing track of what was read.  The latter will need lots of testing, and the sooner the better.

I would suggest we push to the Beta channel after about a day of testing from @samuelclay and @manderson23 if no servere bugs are found.
"
Android: Swipe to refresh,"As discussed in #563 I've implemented swipe to refresh. I've left refresh as an item in the menu as this seems to be the Android UI guidelines.

Android: Oversized Refresh button on Android on very high dpi device.,"https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/bug_oversized_refresh_button_on_android_on_very_high_dpi_device

I assume this is because we only have a single 68x68 refresh icon under drawable (barbutton_refresh.png). If mark all read works that is 80x88. Do we simply need a larger refresh icon?
"
Android: Story Cleanup Blocks on Slow Storage,"Getting reports from users with cache that directs to SD that the cleanup step takes so long that it boggs down sync.  This op can probably run as a lower-priority parallel thread if it is an issue.
"
Android: View Recently-Read Stories,"The web UI now provides a sweet way to go back and find stories you just read.  Should be a snap to add to the android app.
"
Android: Offline Images Break Alt-Text Long-Press,"When cached images are used, long-pressing to get alt text doesn't work.
"
Android: Fetch Text-Mode Data During Sync,"Right now, the call for text-mode data is made when the user is actually reading stories, not as part of fetching stories.  This makes text-mode view unavailable for offline reading and ineligible for all the new sync speedups.
"
Android: Background Sync,"This implements fully-decoupled background sync that can handle realtime interactions and run independently of the UI if so configured.  This also upends the local DB paradigm from delete-and-replace to update-and-merge, allowing story state to be retained for offline reading.  Also included are all the options for background sync, offline reading, and image prefetch.  The new sync status UI is stubbed in, as well.

_Importantly, this is a debug/beta state for the app and not a release version._  There are a number of things intentionally left unifinished:
- The sync UI has been left very informational so we can collect better bug reports before we put the less-informative polish on it.
- Indirect/async mark-read actions have been left out for now so as not to conflate them with the issue being worked in #537. (this means you will get some error noise when reading offline)
- Logging is a bit more noisy than we would have in a release build, causing some mild slowness when syncing.

I will queue up the fixes for the above issues for pull with any bugs we squash during the beta.

That said, the mostly-complete rewrite of the DB should cause first-time sync to be an order of magnitue faster.  Also, all users will now benefit from prefetch of unread stories, even if they never enable background sync.  After a short catch-up period post-upgrade, unread stories will be available for reading immediately, with no delay at all.

I would like to get this into the hands of as many folk as possible, via the beta channel especialy.  I am going to create a new issue category for bugs in this beta, since I am certain there will be some for me to track and fix.

Match Facebook comments from feeds to Shared stories' comments,"When the RSS feed brings back a Facebook story with comments, the comments and the original post are not structured in a ""story"" way.

"Android: Support for ""L"" Devices","The next release of Android (to be released in late 2014 and codenamed something with an ""L"") will require rebuilds and code changes for existing apps to be compatible.  As such, they have released a preview build of the OS for testing.

Backend: Use SNI when fetching feeds,"Mark Nottingham has switched his personal website over to require TLS SNI to access it, and [did a writeup of every client that failed to do so](https://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/05/09/if_you_can_read_this_youre_sniing). NewsBlur was one of them.

A quick dig through the codebase suggests that you're using requests for at least part of your feed fetching! Of course, we're delighted that you're using requests, and we'd like to help you avoid this problem.

Requests can transparently turn on SNI for you. On Python 2.X, you'll need to add the following packages to your list of dependencies: `PyOpenSSL`, `ndg-httpsclient` and `pyasn1`. This should also provide some security benefits, as we turn on a few nicer features and cipher suites when using PyOpenSSL.

This should be all you need to give you access to sites behind SNI. Let me know if you'd like me to help make this happen in any way: I'm a big fan of NewsBlur and use it a lot, so helping make it better would be awesome.

Android: Offline access to stories and images,"Big ticket for handling offline on Android.

Here are the iOS stages, which display in a small bottom-anchored notifier (you should call this the notifier in the code, to match iOS and web):

1) “On its way…"" loads /reader/feeds?flat=true&update_counts=false. Will display cached output of this endpoint before even loading the feeds. Remember that feeds and stories have to be available offline, so you have to cache the output of this endpoint. Might as well show it to the user before the refreshed data comes in.
2) ""Counting is difficult…"" loads /reader/refresh_feeds. Refresh unread counts. Nothing to cache here.
3) ""Syncing stories…” loads /reader/unread_story_hashes?include_timestamps=true. This is your source of truth on unread vs. read status. If it’s not here, it’s read. So I drop the table every time this request succeeds, replacing it with the latest data.
4) “Storing past hour/3 hours/day/3 days…” loads /reader/river_stories?page=0&h=6230:99b991&h=… (up to 100 h’s per request). Alternate between fetching and storing 100 unread story_hashes, updating the text with the latest stored story’s date. Should show a progress bar as a thin red line at the top of the bottom message. See screenshot.
5) “Images from past hour/3 hours/ etc” caches images. This is a slow process. Also optional (and off by default)
6) “All Done” … just shows this message then slides down to hide itself. Since this entire offline process can go awhile, it’s nice to have closure.

Steps 1-3 should show the spinner, as they are active steps. Step 4, which lasts the longest, should not show the spinner. See four attached screenshots. Use the lightning icon, which is in clients/iOS/Resources/g_icn_offline.png. And finish off with “All Done” and a checkmark (clients/ios/resources/checkmark.png), to signify its done.

You’ll need to eventually handle image caching. I have it turned off by default on the iOS app, but it’s a pretty critical feature. The way I handle it is to just sub in cached images (I believe as base64 encoded data urls) when I detect their URLs in the story body. I provide all of the urls you need to cache from a story in the story json, I think in the `image_urls` key. 

I also cache stories in the order users choose for their default story order. So newest first (the default) caches newest stories first, and oldest first caches the oldest stories first.

API - can't delete a feed from all folders,"Hey,
It looks like the `in_folder` param in the `/reader/delete_feed` API call is optional. I thought this means that if I don't POST this value, the feed will be deleted from all folders it exists in. Instead I get a successful API result, but the feed is still subscribed.
Even if the user is only subscribed to the feed in one folder, I have to explicitly POST that folder's name/ID in order for the feed to get deleted.

Thanks.

Which is the same thing but above the feed's name and with the items in reverse order.

This is very confusing, for example, when deleting many feeds in succession, because you never know where the right button is going to be. Also, this means that the ""really delete?"" option appears some times below and some times above the ""delete site"" option. Moreover, when the options are reversed, the original hierarchy breaks, and ""delete site"" is the first option reading the list naturally from top to bottom.

API Call to reader/feeds/ returns the wrong feed IDs?,"Hey
Can't really make a general bug report out of this so I'll just show an example with my account.
So right now, when I'm using the API to fetch all of my feeds (using flat=true), one of the feeds I get back is '5345299'. The problem is - I'm only getting it in the 'flat_folders' array, and not in the 'feeds' array. 

I went to http://www.newsblur.com/site/5345299/ to find out what is this weird looking feed, and it turns out I'm subscribed to it, only on my account it's showing a different feed ID - 4644579.

Samuel - I've emailed you a json file, I think it'll be easier to understand the issue this way.

Thanks.
"
Android: Reconcile unread counts with number of unread stories,"This is the root cause of several user visible bugs -

The app starts and gets a list of feeds (applies to folders, too, but we'll keep it simple for the sake of explanation).  A feed has N unread items at that point.  By the time the feed is opened for reading, it has N+K unreads, as K more stories were found by the server since feed sync.  The first few pages of stories for the feed are received, possibly including the K stories.

Now we have one of several possible problems:

1) K is small.  One or two new stories appeared at the head of the list.  Our unread count is a little low, so we claim to be out of unreads a bit too early, but they were all received in the first set of story paging, so they are all known.

2) K is large.  Enough new stories appeared that (N+K) is greater than the number of stories found in the first few pages.  We only know that N << (N+K) and have no idea what the total unread count is.

3) K is nonzero but at indicies >> N.  Older stories were discovered or marked unread via a different UI.  There are unreads outside the initial set of story pages, but we have no way of knowing.

4) K is negative.  Stories were read via a different UI between sync and loading the feed.  We may feel the need to search for unreads that don't exist, but have no way of knowing until exhausing all pages of stories.

Case 1 is by far the most common, and easy enough to fix with arithmetic, if it is assumed that case 3 is not also in effect.  Case 2 is also mostly fixable with arithmetic.  These fixes are hackish but quick.

Cases 3 and 4 would seem to require re-querying unread counts before opening a feed.  This, however, is indicated by the docs to be too expensive to call as often as necessary to update counts.

How do the other UIs handle this issue?  I know that I have seen related bugs in the web UI (searching down the story list for unreads that are never found), but they seem less common there than in the app.
"
Android: Cannot read all stories in a folder (with a fix!),"I just emailed this to a user:

I can explain the exact nature of the problem, if you like. It’s a caching issue. When you request a river of news, every unread story in that folder is assembled into a list. The key of the cache is simply the signature of the feeds in the folder. But only feeds with unread stories. As you page through the folder, some feeds drop off the “unread” signature as they no longer have unread stories, changing the cache’s signature, thus invalidating the cache. And because you’re paging, you are now N pages into a different cache, which is likely to be empty by that point.

*_The fix is to have all clients record which feeds are in the folder to begin with. *_ However, some folders act differently. Specifically the All Site Stories folder. However, it also could have something to do with the Android app’s way of handling this form of caching. All the client has to do is to keep passing the same feed ids as it pages. 

So, can we add this logic into paging? Don't send which feeds have unreads at that moment. Send a list of feeds that had unreads when the user first opened the folder (at page 1).

Ghost Saved Stories,"Noticed today that the list of saved stories on Android appears to be missing some stories when compared to the web UI.

What is odd is that the missing stories don't exactly behave correctly in the web UI, _either_.  These 'ghost' saved stories all exhibit the following behaviour:
- they have no favicon
- they cannot be read in text mode (""sorry, the story's text could not be extracted"")
- the UI does not show the name of the feed from which they came
- they tend to be older stories

I can confirm that they are valid stories that I remember reading and saving, though.  They can also be read via external link and unsaved just fine.  They all come back via API just fine, but they aren't displayed because they have so much information missing.

"""Show changes revisions in stories"" options somtimes causes image duplication. Cause: CDNs","'ve seen it a lot where on some sites I constantly see stories where the images, the main story image in particular, is shown twice.

Today I finally got annoyed enough by this to look at the html for the story (I had look at the feed itself before but saw no problem there) doing so I noticed that one image was in side a ins tag while the duplicate was in a del tag which of course are used to mark changes/revisions to stories.

Looking at the source for the images as well as where the links contain them were pointing the issues became rather obvious.

First image:
a href: http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/mx3-meizu.png
img src: http://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/mx3-meizu-730x639.png

Second image:

img src: http://cdn2.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/mx3-meizu-730x639.png

See the problem? The site, in this case thenextweb.com is using a CDN for their images and Newsblur's story fetching was served by different nodes at different times.

Would be nice if you could somehow fix this, the duplication can be rather annoying.

<b>Suggestion for fix:</b>
Ignore changes of subdomains for img src and a href (possibly ignore changes to domain altogether). Looking at a couple of sites where I usually have this problem the cause is the same, the subdomain for the link has changed to a different cdn# (from cdn1 to cdn3 for example) but the rest of the URL is of course the same since the content is mirrored between the CDN nodes.

((Oh, I also found while testing that changes to the Story changes option are only applied on a site refresh.))

Android: Refactor Story Loading,"This is the big refactor of story loading.  We no longer blindly blow away the DB and restart at API page 1 at the drop of a hat (switching screens, running out of pages, rotating the screen, etc).

As a result of all this, I'm actually confident now that we don't have to rush the addition of a DB column to track read-during-session status.  This build seems to have eliminated most of the remaining bugs, save for those caused by the rotation bug in reading view.

Additionally, fixed the race condition that was causing the Next Unread button not to work.  However, this fix _will not work on pre-3.0 devices_.  Before we lauch this, we should update the manifest appropriately.

4. When you return, the next 4-5 stories that were unread will cycle in the UI for 5-6 times before actually getting to the original next stories. The new stories remain unread as expected.

Android font sizes/scaling and large tablet,"I use the NewsBlur app on both my phone and tablet. On my phone, the latest update (2.5) looks great. On my large tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1""), not so much. 

The main issue is in the article view. With version 2.1, I used the largest (XL) font size on my 10.1"" tablet. In version 2.5, the XL size has decreased to about the same size as M was on 2.1. This is too small for me -- sure, I can read it, but line length is too long, and the font size is a bit uncomfortable for my middle-aged eyes to read with for long periods.

I attempted to address this by changing my system's font size to a larger setting (even though that would mean adjusting all my other apps downward), but things are not scaling properly in the NewsBlur app. It did increase the font size in the article list, and in the header portion (title etc.) of the article view. The article body text sizes, however, remained the same as before the system change, as did the text in the folder/feed list (though the font for the unread count on that screen did increase).

I have reverted to using a backed-up copy of 2.1 on my tablet, but that's obviously a stopgap.

I'd like to request a change in the font handling, preferably increasing the range of font sizes available in the app so I may choose a larger size for the article text. If that's not feasible at this point, would you please ensure that the fonts used in the app scale properly with the device's font size setting -- as noted above, it is inconsistent currently and doesn't work for my most important use: the article text.

In case it's relevant, the tablet is running Android 4.1 at 1200x800 resolution.

API - request for a small addition to unread_story_hashes,"Hi
It would be really useful for incremental sync implementation, to have the timestamp to be the time the story was first _fetched_ by NewsBlur, and not the actual time of the story.
If this data exists in the NewsBlur DB it would be really useful, and can save a lot of API calls, since I'll be able to only fetch the stories that were added to my account since the last time I synced.

The issue with the timestamp I get now is that stories might get added at a later time to a feed, but have an old date. A good example is http://feeds.feedburner.com/newsyc150, an item might be posted at 12:00 to HN but only get to 150 points after a few hours.

Android: API Retry Logic,"With the refactored API manager, we can now implement #247 properly.  This only triggers retries on very low-level failures such as connects failures, timeouts, etc.  I also implemented exponential backoff logic so the NB servers won't get hammered in the event of duress.  If the server returns a response with an error or throttle message in it (so long as it is a 200), calls will immediately stop.  The retry count and interval were chosen after looking at some logs from failed calls and should be well suited to the top causes of failure - pool exhaustion (very fast) and radio mode switching (1-2 seconds).

Define additional keybindings (S-n and S-p) for selecting the next or previous site.,"In support of [a support request](https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/keyboard_shortcuts-rkca2)  made two months ago, this patch proposes adding two key bindings:
- _Shift-N_ → Next Site
- _Shift-P_ → Previous Site

These are already bound to Shift-J/Shift-↓ and Shift-K/Shift-↑, respectively, so adding a third is likely controversial. The keyboard shortcut help screen already has double-wide entries for these commands; I was reluctant to add a third there, fearing that the layout couldn't handle rows that wide.

Many of the keyboard shortcuts in NewsBlur mimic those from Google Reader, as is the custom in the current flourish of RSS Web-based readers. While Google Reader _accepts_ Shift-J and Shift-K to move among subscriptions, note that its _advertised_ bindings for those commands are Shift-N and Shift-P, as I've proposed adding here.

Better use of vertical space in reader pane?,"It would be nice to change the UI a little in the reader pane to use less vertical space, you can see in the screenshot I took that the title, website, author, and date are duplicated.

Mark previous as read,"Sometimes you scan partway down the story titles in a large folder, and then you have to go do something else. In such cases, it is convenient to mark the items up to the point you've scanned read, so that you can pick up later where you left off.

I would like the ability to right-click on an item's title in the story list and mark all items up to (and including?) that one as read.

"
More font choices for story list,"Currently the web client supports only 2 typefaces: Lucida Grande and Georgia.  These are fine typefaces, but a typical Newsblur user will be scanning _large_ amounts of boldface text (i.e., unread item titles), and the boldface variations of these faces were designed to provide emphasis to short phrases, not for typesetting large amounts of text.  Lucida Grande bold is heavy and does not scan very quickly.

Of course, reasonable people may disagree about which fonts look better in boldface, but I think some additional font choices (or perhaps styling choices for unread items?) are warranted.
"
Keyboard navigation in list view without opening items,"When using List View with the ""Show a single story at a time"" preference, it is currently impossible to navigate down the story pane via the keyboard without loading items. For the reasons set forth in [Issue 321](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/321), I would like to navigate through many items by title only, without loading the contents. So, it would be nice if there were a way to navigate the items list without opening the items.

There would thus have to be some notion of an item having ""focus"" which is separate from the item being ""opened"".

Not opening the first item in the story list automatically would probably fall out as a side effect of implementing this feature, although I suppose technically that could be filed as a separate issue.

This feature is an alternative to Issue 321, as it would also support the Reader-like usage mode of reading through a long list of titles without loading the items. It is probably not necessary to implement both this and Issue 321.

Edit: Hmm, found the support forum. This is basically [the feature request made here](https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/would_love_a_hotkey_to_scan_a_list_title_without_expanding_it).
"
Compact story titles,"Currently, the story titles pane consumes at least 2 vertical lines of text per story title, and more if the title is long (often 3-4 text lines if the story title pane is set to a narrow width).

I would like a preference to compact the story titles to 1 vertical line of text, maximum, with the feed, date, etc. being truncated (overflow: hidden) if it exceeds the width of the story titles pane.
"
Hide story pane,"I would like a feature for hiding the story pane in the web client (desirable when using the story titles pane to navigate rather than the story list).  When the story pane is hidden, the web client should not load items when navigating through story titles (until the story pane gets shown again).  Ideally show/hide should be bound to a keyboard shortcut, much like show/hide of the story titles pane.

When using Google Reader, I used the keyboard to navigate through long lists of feed item titles, and only hit enter to load a small fraction of items.  Currently, it is only possible to selectively load items by navigating with the mouse, and it is impossible to select a folder or feed without at least loading the contents of the first item.

This feature would be especially valuable for browsing image-heavy feeds on limited-bandwidth connections (for example, tethered to a cell phone).  It would also help people who want to (or, for accessibility reasons, are forced to) navigate with the keyboard but don't want to load embedded image bugs for every item in their feed.

Edit: As an alternative, [Issue 323](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur/issues/323) would also allow quick keyboard navigation without loading item bodies. In fact, that fix seems preferable; feel free to deprioritize this issue in favor of that one.

Android: Audio continues to play after leaving story,"Running v. 2.02 on Nexus 4.2.2.
_Steps to reproduce:_
1. Open any story that contains embedded audio from story list.
2. Play audio
3. Leave story by navigating to next/prev story or story list
- Audio continues playing in background. 
- On return to same story, audio player is in default/unplayed state, can be played again which does stop original background audio (but you've just started a new audio player). 
- Only way to stop audio is either play different embedded audio in NewsBlur app, or force quit NewsBlur app.
- No issue with video, but that won't play in background.

Hard to say what is best to do here, the background audio is great but having to force-quit to stop it not so much.

API Methods for Offline Syncing,"/reader/unread_story_hashes returns unread story hashes, which can be compared with my local database to determine which stories need to be downloaded.  So far so good.

But then, there doesn't seem to be a method just to request just the needed items.  The options seem to be to cycle through /reader/feed/:id or /reader/river_stories until all the needed items are found, which seems inefficient.  (In theory, everything should be found in the first few pages of river_stories, but I haven't found that to be the case in practice.)

The other option would be to forgo offline syncing and just call the river_stories methods whenever the user wants access a feed, which is an OK option, I guess, but doesn't allow offline access and is different from other reader service APIs.  (Looks like this is what the official Newsblur apps do, so I guess this is how it's meant to be used.  But then what is unread_story_hashes for?)

Just wondering if there's a method in the API I'm missing.  Otherwise, I guess this is a feature request for a method to either (a) retrieve stories based on story hashes, or (b) only retrieve river_stories items that have changed since a given request date (like the Google Reader API).

FR: Keyboard shortcut to maximise reading area,"Another feature that was very useful in Reader, especially on netbooks and other restricted screen devices, was the ability to maximise the reading area.

While the current NewBlur layout works pretty well on decent sized screen on a relatively low resolution netbook it severely restricts the reading area. While you can re-size the side and bottom elements away it's a suboptimal approach. Ideally such a display mode would be toggled with a keyboard shortcut. On toggling the full-screen mode on it would:
- Hide the left and bottom sidebars
- Reduce/remove the story headers (tags etc)
- Minimise (or perhaps float) the top bar so you still know position in feed (stories left etc)

Obviously you would want to keep NewBlur's left/right arrow story view shortcuts ;-)

Feed ID is undefined when right-clicking the first folder and changing its view settings,"The first folder in my list is ""BBC"". If I right-click and change its settings, the `feed_id` parameter in the `set_view_setting` request is `river:undefined`.

I don't think it's a problem with the folder itself:
- If I move it into another folder, and then change its view settings, `feed_id` is set properly.
- If I move it back to the top level (so it's the first folder again), `feed_id` is `river:undefined` again.
- If I add a new folder that appears before ""BBC"", say ""AAA"", then `feed_id` is set properly when changing view settings for ""BBC"", but is set to `river:undefined` when changing the view settings for ""AAA"" instead.

Note that I can move the ""BBC"" folder when it's first in the list - but I see the `move_folder_to_folder` request uses a `folder_name` parameter, whereas `set_view_setting` uses `feed_id`. Presumably the `folder_name` can be determined properly, but something is going wrong when constructing the `river:xxx` value for `feed_id`.

Cannot read past few items in Android app after migrating from Google Reader,"I opened account in a Newsblur, imported a Google Reader feeds to it.

It says 1928 unreaded story in the main label, but can show only under 10 of them.

Newblur website seems to scroll and load the stories fine.

Issues with the supervisor search path for supervisord.conf ,"The search paths for supervisord.conf seem to apparently vary by distro. Debian (and debian only) has a patch to extend the supervisor search paths to include `/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf`

The supervisor manual ( http://supervisord.org/installing.html#creating-a-configuration-file ) actually specifies that the correct location for the conf file is `/etc/supervisord.conf`.

Furthermore, I'm not sure how supervisor found it's way onto my system (I didn't install it manually, I'm just using the fabfile), but apparently at least the version of supervisor available with ubuntu 12.04 LTS does not have the patch that includes the additional config search paths (I've verified this by looking at the supervisor sources in `dist-packages`).

As such, it seems like the location for the placement of the supervisor conf files should be moved from `/etc/supervisor/` to just `/etc/`. This will pretty much guarantee it will work on most distros.

Android: Better Logic for Sync-on-Startup,"Inspired by:
https://getsatisfaction.com/newsblur/topics/update_feeds_on_application_startup_android_app

At present the android app is very conservative about when it auto-syncs, only executing one without the user pressing the refresh button if the app is cold-starting or after a login.  For users of phones with not-insignificant memory capacity, cold-starts maybe very rare due to caching.

It appears that the correct logic would be to trigger a sync even on a warm start if the last sync was more than 10 minutes in the past.

Android: Fix Mark-As-Read-While-Reading Workflow,"Finally putting issue #144 to rest by refactoring the way that all `Reading` activities handle the collection and submission of mark-as-read operations as stories are read.

Tested all the various reading styles (feed, folder, social feed, allstories, allsharedstories) to ensure things now work in real-time.  Did uncover and document one additional existing bug that I couldn't fix at present (see the TODO in FeedUtils).

This also fixed the number 1 reported crash for the current version of the app.

Typo fix and some work making things a little more generic,"Here is the typo fix for fabfile.py.

I also broke the stuff that switches you over to zsh out into a separate fab command (and stuck it in setup_all). That should make it a little more obvious that setup_all will change your shell, as well as make it easier to disable.

My text editor (sublime text) automatically trims trailing spaces upon every save, so that happened too.

I haven't actually managed to get a complete install working yet, so I can't say I didn't introduce any bugs. It certainly loads with `fab`, but there are a lot of assumptions about pre-existing folder structure that must be met before the install will work properly, and I'm still puzzling them out.

Right now, the fabfile fails because it's trying to ln -fs on top of a existing folder.

Ensure All Stories Heading Always Appears,"This is the more complete fix for Issue #209 where the All Stories heading was not appearing if the user had no feeds in the top-level/root folder.

As agreed by the devs, this also implements #139 to wipe the local database on upgrade to prevent bugs caused by non-forward-compatibility.  The local prefs store is retained, so at least users do not have to re-login on upgrade.

This fix is admittedly grotesque.  The root cause of these bugs has been the high degree of magic found in the `FeedProvider` wrapper around the standard Android `ContentProvider`.  I added some warning documentation and some helpful debugging tools, but this whole class is an antipattern that needs to be resolved at some point.  We are deep into SQL that sqlite handles in a buggy and undocumented fashion.

We should test this very well before pushing to market.  I created a ""test_norootfeeds"" (no pw) account that very specifically exercises the original bug.

Next unread looks for next unread, but try this on the web -- load a feed then hit 'm' to load the last unread item. Then hit next. See how it goes up, and doesn't start from the top and go down? Replicate that (it's trivial. just look down, see nothing, then look up from current position).

Web: Feature Request - Add Hover Text for Hotkeys,"To discover some of the hotkeys (I guarantee I don't know most of them) I just guessed and pressed buttons that I would use for hotkeys. I happened to get most correct, but I'd love to have a way to easily identify these in the interface.

It'd be great to have some simple text on common buttons to make the hotkey discovery easy. For example here's a quickly modified ""Next Unread"" button to show the hotkey when I hover over the button.

``` html
<div class=""NB-task-button-wrapper"" title=""Press: N"">
    <div class=""task_button_background""></div>
    <div class=""NB-task-image""></div>
    <span class=""NB-task-title"">Next Unread</span>
</div>
```

It results in the following:

Obviously, there needs to be a little work done with the CSS to get the placement correct but I think this gets the idea across.
"
"Web: Bug Using ""Next Unread"" When Viewing Updated Feed","Issue: When viewing a feed that has had new Unread items added to it (to the top of the stack) and clicking the ""Next Unread"" button what happens is that it traverses the list downwards to try and find the unread item never actually getting to the top of the list.

Expected Result: When viewing a feed that has been updated with Unread items and no more unread items exist lower in the stack than is currently being viewed it automatically goes to the top of the stack to show the newest unread item.

Quick Example, I have the following items in my feed (bold are unread, normal are read)
- **Cookies Are Awesome**
- **Try Our New Cookie Bowls**
- Bacon is Amazing

Once I have opened this feed and viewed all of the unread items my list is then transformed to this:
- Cookies Are Awesome
- Try Our New Cookie Bowls _(My browser is currently viewing this item)_
- Bacon is Amazing

Then my feed is automatically updated with a new item, to be:
- **I Like Turtles**
- Cookies Are Awesome
- Try Our New Cookie Bowls _(My browser is still currently viewing this item)_
- Bacon is Amazing

With this new unread item above the item holding focus currently and I hit ""Next Unread"" the read items in the list are then traversed and I never get up to the new **I Like Turtles** post.

**Note:** I have only been able to reproduce this when viewing posts then navigating in other tabs, marking an item as read to try and reproduce it doesn't allow me to reproduce it. What it looks like is happening to me is that when I am scrolled down outside of the buffer for the post list it doesn't get updated with the new items.

Feature Request: Configurable S3 hostname,"There are a large number of competitor S3 services out there now, and you can even host your own S3 object container service.  Currently, NewsBlur has uses the default Amazon S3 hostname.  Many of these services use the S3 API and can be used as drop-in replacement's for Amazon's service.

I would like to request that a couple new configuration options be added:

S3_HOSTNAME
S3_PORT

This could be set to Amazon's by default, but can be customized if needed.

The boto library does allow for setting a custom host and port, as well as proxy if necessary when creating the S3Connection instance.

I propose to introduce a pop-up menu which appears after a long touch on the image. It should offer an option to view the original image, or read the `alt`-text:
- `[ view in full resolution ]`  -- launches an external or built-in full screen viewer
- `[ image text                  ]`  -- shows the title and the alternative text

If an external viewer is used via `android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW`, then all other operations on the image (saving, editing, sharing) could be done in other apps.

River of news on folder sometimes showing all items unread?,"In my example here I am clicking on 'Deal Sites' folder to get river of news for all sub-feeds.

I don't see this for all my folders so not sure what is special about this one.  The Android and iOS app are doing the same thing so it must be on back end.

Android: Story traversal buttons on the bottom of every story,"I've been noodling on this for a bit and I think I have a great solution.

On the right, use the new story traversal buttons from the iOS app. It's a rounded rect with a big Next unread button and a small previous button (check the Dropbox screenshots).

I am hoping to add a circular progress indicator to that next button today. But they all appear when you're at the bottom of a story. If you can, get Xcode and run the Newsblur iOS app in the iOS Simulator. It's all free and easy to install, but it's a 4GB download. But if you do this we can talk about syncing the two platforms far better.

Fix duplicate feed problem and folder collapse/expand bug in main feed list view,"duplicate feed problem:

There was a bug in our ExpandableListView around returning inconsistent getGroupIds.

collapse/expand bug:

Changed preferences to store folder name rather than DB folder id.  DB folder id changes when you switch between views and when you do a refresh so it wasn't reliable.

Fix force close for Android when non-premium users try to add fees via auto_complete,"For stability reasons Sam temporarily turned off the auto_complete API call for non-premium users.  The API was returning a server 'Message' response that wasn't parsable by gson and it threw error which force closed the app.  We can now handle both the expected feed list response and the 'Message' response.  The text within the message will now be shown to the user to provide greater context as to why the request failed.

Configurable trim_feed handling,"(Fixes #120)

Introduce additional flags in settings.py for controlling how feed-trimming (purging old articles) behaves.

In `settings.py`, add a few new flags:
- `TRIM_STORIES` is the master enabled/disabled switch. Enabled by default.
- `TRIM_STORIES_KEEP_DAYS` is the minimum # of days to keep articles around for. I choose 180 days as the default.
- `TRIM_STORIES_KEEP_NUM` is the minimum # of articles to keep per feed. I choose 100 stories as the default.

In `apps/rss_feeds/models.py` (`trim_feed`), respect new `TRIM_STORIES*` flags. If `TRIM_STORIES` is enabled, if there are over `TRIM_STORIES_KEEP_NUM` stories in a given feed, pick a threshold-date for the purge by picking the lesser of the two dates between the date of the `TRIM_STORIES_KEEP_NUM`'th story in the feed versus the `Now`-`TRIM_STORIES_KEEP_DAYS` date. In other words, ensure that we keep at least `TRIM_STORIES_KEEP_DAYS` worth of articles and at least `TRIM_STORIES_KEEP_NUM` worth of articles.

"
Articles Being Incorrectly Auto-Purged...?,"I'm seeing a strange problem on my self-hosted install of Newsblur: only the newest 100 articles from any given feed are sticking around in the back-end database. Or at least that's what I seems like:
- For high-traffic feeds, after letting them sit for a few days, they're all pegged at 100 unread items. If I view the feed in All + Newest mode, the list ends after 100 articles.
- For mid-traffic feeds, even though the unread count isn't at 100, I'm still only able to see 100 articles total in All + Newest mode.

I definitely don't see this behavior on http://dev.newsblur.com/. So, that makes me think it's some kind of problem with my config/settings.  I didn't see anything obvious in the `settings.py` or `local_settings.py` files.  And I didn't see any obvious settings anywhere in the back-end MySQL database.

A few more details, in case they're relevant:
- My install is following the ""circular"" branch from Github.
- I used `./manage.py loaddata config/fixtures/bootstrap.json` during the install process to bootstrap my DB.
- I have a crontab entry that is running `manage.py refresh_feeds --force` every 15 minutes. I also have other crontab entries for running `manage.py collect_stats` and `... collect_feedback` every 15 minutes.

Any ideas on what's going on here? Is there some setting/tunable that I'm overlooking?

Thanks!

Backend: User data dump (& import),"I would really like to see a way to export all of a user's data from NewsBlur.

document keyboard shortcut to add site/folder,"Hey. I don't know if you even accept pull requests, but I mentioned a shortcut to add a site would be nice as a keyboard shortcut a few months ago on the survey you did on the newsblur blog and just discovered it already exists by accident a few days ago. I will be honest and say I haven't tested this change but I figured at the very least it would draw your attention to the fact that this shortcut isn't documented on the keyboard shortcut modal and I think it should be since I found it very useful. If you'd like me to change this at all I'm happy to spend a little more time doing it properly - for now I basically just copied the formatting of the other items and hoped for the best. I don't know if the fact that there's only one item on this new line will break any formatting; maybe there's another undocumented shortcut you could add as well to even it out?

Rss Table tags interact poorly with blog templates,"![table](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/243503/12551/bd7ea122-459f-11e2-95bb-e0eb22987329.png)

Would it be possible to have the ""snippet text"" (as requested in different feature), story text, and user comments all be unique fields in the RSS without additional markup to more easily be munged by various tools (like ifttt?)

Optimally, I'd like to make the template

File gets auto-downloaded upon viewing certain posts,"Sometimes when I read a story from Mother Jones (in Feed view), the file ""wp-login.php.webintents"" is downloaded to my computer with no confirmation prompt (Windows 7, Chrome 22) and a popup asking me to select a feed reader appears. Neither of these events occurs when viewing the same story on the MJ website itself, of course (but I checked just in case!).

Direct link: https://newsblur.com/site/10134/mother-jones

FAQ,
Adding a new site is pretty slow,"I have become a little addicted to the Newsblur bookmarklet. However, adding a new site to Newsblur tends to be pretty slow, especially if you simply try to add a site using the root domain.

I imagine internally it's using feedparser, but not sure why it's taking so long to detect a feed. Most of the sites I test with this have /feed addresses and LINK REL tags that point to RSS/Atom in the root document. I have observed wait times of between 15 seconds and a full minute. I also occasionally notice timeouts.

Publicly (unauthenticated) river-of-news RSS export,"It would be pretty cool to be able to be able to have an easily accessible RSS feed that is created from all of our subscriptions (the river of news). The benefit of that is simple clients can still use NewsBlur to a minimal degree.

I'd imagine you'd have to create some type of identifier, external to the user ID/name so that they aren't easily guessable. Perhaps also having to opt-in to the feature?

Current goal: There is a really awesome Android widget called [Minimal Reader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jv.cleanwidgets) which does support arbitrary RSS/Atom feeds. To give it my curated list of stories (only those with positive rankings) would be a nice treat to the device. (With Blar used for the other stories & a more 'full' experience.)
